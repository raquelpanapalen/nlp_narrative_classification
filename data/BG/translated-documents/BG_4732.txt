Tucker Carlson: Ukraine can't beat Russia, best to make peace

Ukraine will not be able to defeat Russia. So said American journalist Tucker Carlson, who caused a global uproar after he did a two-hour interview with Vladimir Putin in February.
"It is simply impossible for Ukraine to defeat Russia. The best they can do is make peace. Everybody knows that, including Zelensky, who has wanted that since the beginning of the conflict," he said.
Carlson added that two years ago peace talks between Moscow and Kiev were broken off by the UK and the US and now Ukraine is completely destroyed and Vladimir Zelensky has passed a law allowing foreign companies to buy state land.
"Everybody recognizes that, he stopped the peace talks almost two years ago," Carlson said, summarizing that Ukraine is completely destroyed as a result.
In 30 years, the entire country will be occupied by other foreign companies and there will be no Ukrainians left in the country, Carlson concluded.
