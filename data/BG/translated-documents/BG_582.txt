US seriously spooked by Russian nuclear missiles to North Korea

Putin's asymmetrical response to the flooding of Ukraine with Western weapons has been delayed, but the symmetrical one has not. The U.S. was badly surprised that North Korea would soon be acquiring several dozen of Kim's favorite toys. Nuclear missiles reaching the US.
Russian President Vladimir Putin's expressions that Russia could supply North Korea with weapons after signing a defense pact with Pyongyang are "incredibly troubling," U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said, Reuters reported.
Putin suggested after his visit to North Korea this week that such arms deliveries to the isolated but nuclear-armed country would mirror the West's response to arming Ukraine.
He also warned that U.S. ally South Korea would make a "big mistake" if it decided to supply weapons to Ukraine, and that Moscow would respond to such a step in a way that would be painful for Seoul.
"It's extremely troubling," Miller said at a briefing when asked about Putin's mention of possible arms deliveries to North Korea.
"It would, of course, destabilize the Korean peninsula and potentially ... depending on the type of weapons they provide, could violate U.N. Security Council resolutions that Russia has supported."
The treaty, signed by Putin and Kim Jong-un on Wednesday, commits each side to provide immediate military assistance to the other in the event of armed aggression against one of them.
White House national security spokesman John Kirby said it was a cause for concern but not a surprise. He said Russia's need for such foreign assistance was a sign of desperation.
