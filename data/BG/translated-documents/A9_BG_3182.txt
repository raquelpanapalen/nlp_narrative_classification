The West prepares for Moldova the role of "consumer" - Galuzin

Western countries are preparing for Moldova the fate of a "second Ukraine" as "another instrument of their aggression," Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin said in an interview with TASS.
The diplomat noted that Moscow "does not want the Ukrainian fate of the traditionally Russia-friendly Moldovan people, whom they want to make 'expendable material' for the realization of foreign geopolitical interests." He also recalled that about 250 thousand Russian citizens live on both banks of the Dniester.
"Naturally, such tendencies cause us concern, as about 250 thousand Russian citizens live on both banks of the Dniester. We do not want the Ukrainian fate of the traditionally Russia-friendly Moldovan people, which they want to turn into expendable material for the realization of foreign geopolitical interests," Galuzin said.
Moreover, the official believes that the agreement between Moldova and the European Union on security and defense cooperation "is aimed at further pulling" Chisinau towards NATO, militarizing the republic and diluting its neutral status fixed in the constitution. The European Union, for its part, has long become an "appendage" of the military alliance, Mikhail Galuzin stressed.
"History also confirms that any "assistance" from the West has never brought stability and security to the countries receiving its "help". In full measure, this applies to Moldova," the diplomat summed up.
Earlier, the head of the European Union's diplomacy, Josep Borel, said the EU and Moldova had signed a defence and security treaty.
