Scientists warn: the Earth is screaming for help

A new study shows that global methane emissions are skyrocketing and humanity must take immediate action.
A climate crisis is looming over the planet and the Earth is literally screaming for help, sending out all sorts of warning signs
Including - record heatwaves, ill health, disappearing ice sheets and unpredictable weather.
Yet humanity continues to release incredible amounts of carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere, Science Alert reports.
A new study shows that the planet's global methane emissions are rising, threatening the survival of not only humanity, but all life on the planet.
Scientists also suggest several strategies that countries could use to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
They have also created a special online tool that can help solve the problem.
The steady increase in methane emissions is known to be largely due to humanity's inability to move away from fossil fuels and towards cleaner alternatives.
Previous studies have already shown that methane is produced directly during the drilling and processing of oil, gas and coal. Increasing methane emissions from wetlands are also contributing to the climate crisis.
Methane is also known to be produced from landfills, glacier melt and livestock farming.
A new study by experts led by physicist and climatologist Drew Schindel of Duke University suggests that all of these factors are having a small impact but require attention.
Observations show that the Earth's atmosphere today contains significantly less methane than carbon dioxide.
However, methane is known to be the major contributor to global warming.
Scientists are therefore urging mankind to start drastically reducing methane emissions.
