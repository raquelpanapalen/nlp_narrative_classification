Moscow: US drones over Black Sea increase risk of direct confrontation between NATO and Russia

Flights of US strategic drones over the Black Sea increase the likelihood of incidents with Russian Air Force aircraft, which in turn increases the risk of confrontation between NATO and the Russian Federation. This was warned by the Ministry of Defense in Moscow, TASS and Focus reported.
The department noted the increased intensity of flights of US unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) over the Black Sea.
"These drones carry out reconnaissance and direct high-precision weapons at targets that Western countries hand over to the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) for strikes on Russian territory," the Russian Defense Ministry pointed out.
"This shows the growing involvement of the US and NATO countries in the conflict in Ukraine on the side of the Kiev regime. Such flights significantly increase the likelihood of incidents in the airspace with aircraft of the Russian Aerospace Forces, which increases the risk of a direct confrontation between the Alliance and the Russian Federation," the Russian Foreign Ministry warned, adding that "NATO countries will bear responsibility for this."
Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov has instructed the army's General Staff to draw up proposals for measures to respond quickly to "American provocations" over the Black Sea.
