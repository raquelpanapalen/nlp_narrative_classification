Fico calls for vote in EP elections for pro-peace candidates
BRATISLAVA, 8 June. /TASS/. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, who was assassinated on May 15, voted in the European Parliament elections and urged voters to vote for candidates who "will support peace initiatives and not the continuation of war." He wrote about it on Facebook (Banned in the Russian Federation).
"I voted in the hospital because this election is also important. It is necessary to elect MEPs who will support peace initiatives and not the continuation of the war, writes Fico. "The consent given by Western countries to Ukraine to use Western weapons to attack targets on Russian territory is only proof that the major Western democracies do not want peace, but an escalation of tensions with Russia, which will of course happen."
Fico writes that as long as he is prime minister of Slovakia, he will not involve the republic in military adventures. "Within the limits of our small Slovak capabilities, I will do everything to give priority to peace over war," the Slovak head of state noted.
