CHIEF, YOU STUPID ASS!

In the last decades Bulgaria has not had the luck to have men as prime ministers. The caretaker, although he tries to pretend to be a ficus and nobody notices him, has ugly stuck to our attention with another idiocy. He took a picture with some idiots, one known and one unknown, and claimed that Bulgaria was committed to the EU and NATO response to Russian aggression against Ukraine? How is it committed, you fool? Ukraine is not a member of either NATO or the EU. Ukraine does not even have internationally recognised borders. A new Nazism has begun to grow in Ukraine. People were burning alive and killing children in Ukraine in 2014. In Ukraine, men and women proudly tattooed or wore the swastika, which has been denied by the civilised world.
Bulgaria is a loyal vassal of the United States. And ready to become a Kurban for American interests in Ukraine. Your government, fool, is again sending "surplus" weapons to Ukraine. Well, with this undermanned army of ours, we don't need weapons. Just an honor escort, when someone attacks us, to escort them more formally to Sofia! What you are doing by disarming our military is TREASON and STATE TREASON.
Fool, Bulgaria does not want to go to war, it does not care about NATO interests and US interests. Bulgaria wants peace, wants good relations with Russia, at least from a purely practical point of view. Bulgaria does not want herds of migrants from Ukraine to come here with their shiny SUVs and support them. Bulgaria does not want to become a launching pad for attacks against Russia. Where are you off to, you fool, to speak for Bulgaria?
Another fool in government. Pathetic, cowardly and stupid!
