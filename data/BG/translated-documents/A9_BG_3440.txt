Ukraine categorically rejected Moscow's ceasefire offer

The terms spoke eloquently of "the inability of the current Russian leadership to adequately assess the realities," a Zelensky adviser commented
A senior Ukrainian adviser has rejected the conditions set by Russian President Vladimir Putin for the start of peace talks. According to Mikhailo Podolyak, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky, Putin's conditions are quite specific and highly offensive to international law.
Putin: I stop the war if Ukraine gives up NATO and what Russia seized
"They speak absolutely eloquently about the inability of the current Russian leadership to adequately assess the realities," Podolyak points out.
He shows how "point by point" the Russian head of state's conditions look:
1. Give us your territories.
2. Give up your sovereignty
3. Allow yourselves to be unprotected (no alliances).
4. Remove all sanctions completely and immediately so we can replenish our militarized economy and make more investments in information provocations around the world.
5. Let's urgently fix Russia's "no/fail" at Ukraine's expense.
"Of course, there is no novelty in this, no real proposals for peace, no desire to end the war. But there is a desire not to pay for this war and to continue in new formats. All this is a complete disgrace. Therefore - once again, free yourselves from illusions and stop taking seriously "Russia's proposals", which are offensive to common sense," Podolyak said, bTV reports.
