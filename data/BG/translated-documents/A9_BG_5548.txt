Zelensky: Europe is no longer a continent of peace

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told the French parliament today that Europe is a continent of war and that Russia will not stop its aggression on his country's borders, DPA reports.
Zelensky is on an official visit to France, where he will be received by President Emmanuel Macron at the Elysee Palace.
"We are living in a time when Europe is no longer a continent of peace, unfortunately," Zelensky said in his address to French lawmakers, adding that European towns and villages continue to be destroyed in Russian bombardments in Ukraine. He also condemned the abduction of Ukrainian children in the occupied territories.
"Now it is directed against Ukraine, but tomorrow it may be the turn of other countries, and we can already clearly see the direction of aggression - the Baltic republics, Poland, the Balkans," the Ukrainian president said. He noted the Russian military actions in Syria and the Russian presence in the Sahel region of Africa, which he said show that "the Russian regime does not recognise borders."
Zelensky also said that Russian President Vladimir Putin is also trying to "weaken" countries through food and energy insecurity. He thanked France for its support and said he hoped to see French warplanes in Ukrainian skies soon after French President Emmanuel Macron announced he would provide Ukraine with Mirage 2000 fighter jets.
Zelensky has long expressed frustration with how long it is taking Western allies to make key decisions about military support for Ukraine and actually send aid, Reuters notes.
