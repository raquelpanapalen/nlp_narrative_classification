Bulgaria to get ready: a Swiss scientist made a terrible forecast on BTV

In 50 years, part of the Amazon rainforest will be gone and turned into savannah. Spain and the entire Mediterranean are drying up and gradually turning into deserts. This gloomy forecast of the world's future was outlined by Dr Vladimir Simeonov from the Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Switzerland.
"I have been following the processes for 30 years. Usually the reality is closer to the bad predictions than to the average. Let alone the optimal ones. That's because we continue to emit gases that cause the planet to warm at an increasing rate, not just that we are not reducing it," Dr Simeonov said on the BBC.
"In the next 50 years, part of the Amazon is expected to disappear, to become a savannah, which will change the climate not only of the Americas but of the whole world," he said. Asked whether Spain and Portugal were doomed to become deserts, he replied: 'If we continue like this, maybe yes. And that goes for the whole Mediterranean".
"Maybe those born in 2023 will remember it as the coldest winter of their lives," the scientist said. What is worrying, he said, is that there is no telling when irreversible changes might begin. At first, we can expect extreme events such as hail and droughts, as well as heat waves.
"Bulgaria will also gradually move towards a warmer climate. Bulgaria is not very rich in water resources, although one of the myths is that we are. Our water depends a lot on forests and here comes one of my concerns," Dr Simeonov said.
Dr. Simeonov explained that the earth has gone through a lot of climate change, but the difference is that now the rate of change is much higher. Therefore, there will be many climate migrants in the future.
