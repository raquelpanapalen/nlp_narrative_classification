Putin: Russia's proposals envisage end of conflict in Ukraine

Russian President Vladimir Putin is counting on the "Primakov Readings" that have begun in Moscow to have an exchange of views on Russia's peace initiatives that have been rejected by the West, and that the participants in the forum will be able to see that they actually foresee the possibility of ending the conflict in Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin said.
"I proceed from the fact that the forum will pay due attention to the Russian ideas on the formation of a system of equal, indivisible security and mutually beneficial cooperation on the Eurasian continent, as well as our new proposal for a peaceful settlement of the Ukrainian crisis. I hope that, unlike many Western politicians, who did not even want to go into the essence of our proposed initiative, the participants in the forum will approach it thoughtfully and rationally and will be able to see that it really provides an opportunity to stop the conflict and move towards its political and diplomatic settlement," Putin said in his address to the participants and organizers of the Primakov Anniversary Readings.
The head of state's address was read out by his assistant for international affairs, Yury Ushakov.
