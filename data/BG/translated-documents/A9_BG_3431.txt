US and UK are preparing sabotage for Ukraine against Russia - Maria Zakharova

Washington and London are planning and preparing large-scale sabotage operations against Russia for the Ukrainian government, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told a briefing.
"The Anglo-Saxons are openly inciting the Kiev regime to carry out barbaric terrorist attacks. Obviously the destruction is not enough for them ; they are encouraging direct strikes deep into Russia and even that is not enough. Now Washington and London have started planning large-scale sabotage," said Maria Zakharova.
The diplomat drew attention to the publication of the British edition of the Daily Express that in the event of some military success or victory of the Russian armed forces in Ukraine, Vladimir Zelensky "will want to carry out terrorist activity inside Russia, and this will consist in bombing schools and other civilian sites.
"Western media are already writing this. This implies that the newspaper, authors and, as we see, many public figures and journalists are already stating the terrorist activity of the Kiev regime. The last thing left for them is to admit the obvious, that all this is possible, all this terrorist activity of the Kiev regime is possible exclusively and only with the money of the collective West," the Russian Foreign Ministry official stressed.
It should be recalled that earlier the Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of Russia Dmitry Medvedev said that Ukraine has actually become a terrorist state that freely kills both its own and foreign citizens.
