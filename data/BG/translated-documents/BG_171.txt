Is a new ice age coming?

Climate change has always been part of our planet's history. From its formation billions of years ago until today, the Earth has experienced dramatic climatic events, including several ice ages.
The question of whether the Earth can survive another ice age is once again coming to the fore, especially in the context of global warming and climate change. But, let's look at the scientific evidence that supports or rejects the possibility of a new ice age, and the possible consequences for our planet and humanity.
What is an ice age?
Ice ages are periods of time during which large parts of the Earth's surface are covered by ice caps and glaciers. They are characterised by significant drops in temperature and long-lasting ice sheets. Over the past 2.4 billion years, Earth has experienced several such epochs, with the most recent, called the Pleistocene Ice Age, ending about 11,700 years ago.
How do ice ages form?Milankovitch orbital cycles
One of the main theories for the formation of ice ages is related to the Milankovitch orbital cycles. According to this theory, changes in the Earth's orbit, the tilt of its axis and the precession of the axis lead to changes in the amount of solar energy that reaches the planet's surface. These changes in solar radiation can cause long-term climate changes, including glacial and interglacial periods.
Volcanic activity
Volcanic activity also plays a role in climate change. Large volcanic eruptions can eject huge amounts of dust and aerosols into the atmosphere, reducing the solar radiation reaching the Earth and lowering temperatures.
Continental drift
Continental drift and changes in the position of continents can affect ocean currents and global climate. For example, the existence of large continents in the polar regions can contribute to the formation of ice caps and lower global temperatures.
Global warming and the ice age: Could it be the other way around?
Global warming caused by human activity and increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are causing global temperatures to rise. This phenomenon seems to contradict the idea of a new ice age. However, some scientists warn that long-term climate cycles and natural processes may cause a temporary cooling despite the current warming.
Potential mechanisms
One potential mechanism for possible cooling is related to the slowing or stopping of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), which includes the Gulf Stream. This ocean current plays an important role in regulating climate in the Northern Hemisphere. Research suggests that global warming and melting ice in Greenland could lead to a slowing of the AMOC, which could cause significant cooling in Europe and North America.
The scientific evidence and models. Paleoclimatological evidence
Studies of ice cores, marine sediments, and other paleoclimate data provide important information about past climate change and ice ages. They show that the Earth has experienced periods of significant cooling and warming associated with orbital cycles and other factors.
Climate models
Modern climate models use this data to predict future climate change. Although most models predict continued global warming, some include scenarios of temporary cooling caused by natural factors such as volcanic activity or changes in ocean currents.
Consequences of a new ice age: Impacts on ecosystems
An ice age would have significant consequences for global ecosystems. Many plant and animal species would be forced to migrate or adapt to new climatic conditions. This could lead to mass species extinctions and changes in biodiversity.
Socio-economic impacts
A new ice age would have serious socio-economic consequences. Agriculture and food resources would be severely affected, which could lead to global food crises. Cold weather would affect energy consumption, increasing the need for heating and raising energy costs.
Impact on infrastructure
Infrastructure would also be affected. Glacial conditions would hamper transport links, especially in northern regions. Freezing of waterways and destruction of infrastructure by ice events would lead to serious challenges for the economy and people's daily lives.
What can we do?
It is important that we continue to monitor climate change and invest in research. Studying paleoclimate data and using advanced climate models will help us better understand and prepare for potential risks.
Adaptation and resilience
Developing strategies for adaptation and increasing resilience to climate change is essential. This includes improving infrastructure, investing in sustainable agriculture and developing technologies to manage natural resources.
International cooperation
Climate change is a global problem that requires international cooperation. Countries need to work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, share scientific data and coordinate efforts to tackle the impacts of climate change.
The question of whether the Earth can survive a new ice age is complex and requires extensive scientific research. Although global warming is a major focus of today's climate research, we should not ignore the possibility of temporary cooling or other climate anomalies caused by natural factors, writes Meteo Balkans
