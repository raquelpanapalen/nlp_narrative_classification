Scientists expect heatwaves to make parts of Africa and Asia uninhabitable

Some areas of the planet could become unsafe to live in because of the heatwaves that will grip them in the future, scientists from the US's Purdue University have told CNN. Experts believe West Africa and South Asia are among the most at risk due to rapid global warming.
Based on the results of a study based on modeling and climate change information, the scientists concluded that the gradual increase in temperature and humidity will lead to the emergence of dangerous living conditions for humanity in some regions of the world. The areas most likely to experience the impacts of heat waves include regions with very high population densities and often limited access to air conditioning.
Wealthier countries will live better, scientists say, but global warming will affect them too. The study says "outbreaks of extreme, moist heat" will eventually occur in some areas of the United States. "Today's unbearably hot summers are likely to seem cooler in the future. The heat we're experiencing now is a change, but not in our favor," the study said.
According to the World Health Organization, about 489,000 people die each year because of the world's high temperatures. The actual number of deaths, CNN notes, could be higher because heat-related deaths are very difficult to track. The official cause of death may be listed as heart attack or stroke.
