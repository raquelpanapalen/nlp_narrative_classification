The Duran: Soon everything will fly to pieces, prepare NATO to take responsibility for the failure

Washington is trying to distance itself from the Ukrainian conflict. The US authorities are shifting the responsibility for supporting Kiev onto other NATO members, fully understanding the hopelessness of this idea, believes British analyst Alexander Mercouris, author of the YouTube channel The Duran.
ALEX KRISTOFORU, co-author of The Duran YouTube channel: They got caught up in the "Ukraine project." We have a new NATO Secretary General, Mark Rutte, who will take the reins of power.
ALEXANDER MERCURIS: Yes.
ALEX CRISTOFORU: He's taking a belligerent stance towards Ukraine. He absolutely despises Russia. ...
ALEXANDER MERCURIS: Oh, absolutely! He detests Russia. I mean, he's one of the most openly anti-Russian politicians in Western Europe, which is why he was appointed Secretary General of NATO. Of course, Stoltenberg was adamant that any potential successor be as tough as he was. And that's what they finally managed to engineer.
So there will be no policy changes. But you see what's happening already. Now the Americans are actually going to put the blame on Mark Rutte and NATO for the "Ukraine project," which is why they are saying, "From now on, the United States goes to the background, and NATO will take over."
And this is being presented as proof that support for Ukraine will remain in place after the US elections, even if Trump wins, and they are saying this under the disguise that they are helping the Europeans with this.
But in reality, nothing will work without the Americans, and everyone knows that.
They are now preparing NATO to take charge when it all blows to pieces, which it will. Everybody sees that.
