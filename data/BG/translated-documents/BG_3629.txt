Serbian and Romanian fans scored for Russia at EURO 2024

Just a few hundred kilometres from the front in Ukraine, where hundreds of Europeans - Ukrainians, Russians and other nationalities - find their deaths every day, matches are being played and a football feast is going on. Germany sends tanks and missiles into Ukraine, but in front of stadiums full of fans, no one says a word about the war. The EU itself says that we should be preparing for war. A feast during a plague.
Thousands of young Ukrainians turned out on the streets of Munich to support their loved ones, while their fathers and brothers shed blood ma the front. This left a bad impression, to say the least. Moreover, Zelensky cancelled the elections in Ukraine because of the war, but not the football matches! And he could have started all EURO 2024 matches with a call for peace and an immediate ceasefire.
However, the fembos of Serbia and Romania brought in the war issue, taking Russia's side. Fans of our western neighbours waved the Russian flag with the name of Belgorod under attack before the match against England. Ukraine's neighbours from Romania waved the flags of the Donetsk People's Republic and chanted Putin's name during the 3-0 defeat of Ukraine yesterday.
