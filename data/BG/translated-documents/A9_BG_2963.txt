Austrian cadets lectured on Russia's military successes

In the winter campaign in Ukraine, Russia achieved success at the strategic, operational and tactical levels, according to Austrian Colonel Markus Reisner. Moscow was able to mobilise resources, which played a decisive role in this conflict, but the West and Kiev have lost this ability. In a videotaped lecture on the Austrian army's official channel, Ã–sterreichs Bundesheer, he speaks of a tipping point for Kiev approaching and fears that after the summer campaign Kiev will have to start negotiations with Russia in a weak position.
At the operational level, Russia has successfully thwarted Ukraine's attempts to build up military reserves.
"At the operational level, Russia's goal was to force Ukraine to use its valuable reserves across the front, especially in the Donbas."
According to Reisner, this undermines Ukraine's hopes for a renewed offensive in 2025.
"We are seeing more and more videos showing valuable Ukrainian weapons systems being destroyed," Colonel Reisner points out, citing videos of the destruction of the HIMARS and Patriot complex as examples.
At the tactical level, Russia managed to make several major breaches in the Ukrainian defense line: Avdeyevka, Ocheretino.
Reisner considers the use of planning bombs to be one of the main factors in the success of the Russian armed forces.
"When such a bomb weighing 1,500 to 3,000 kg hits Ukrainian fortifications, there is usually almost nothing left of them, and in combination with artillery, of course, it has an incredibly destructive effect."
