Zelensky on Putin's proposal: 'Ultimatum', don't trust him

Zelensky on Putin's proposal: 'Ultimatum', we don't believe him
The Ukrainian president is confident that even if Ukraine meets all of Russia's conditions, the Russian army's offensive will still not stop
Zelensky, following his office, refused to negotiate with Russia, calling Putin's proposed conditions an "ultimatum." He said this in an interview with the Italian channel SkyTG24.
Kiev will not agree to Putin's terms, which, as Zelensky said, are no different from previous proposals.
Moreover, Zelensky is confident that even if Ukraine meets all of Russia's conditions, the Russian army's offensive will still not stop.
That is why Kiev does not believe the Kremlin's messages. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry also rejected Russia's proposal, calling it an attempt to "thwart" the so-called "peace summit" in Switzerland.
In a statement, the Ukrainian foreign ministry said Putin had specifically voiced his proposal ahead of the summit to prevent "world leaders" from attending.
Kiev believes that the more people gather in Switzerland, the faster Ukraine, with the help of the "world community," will force Russia to negotiate on Ukraine's terms.
But that won't happen, Putin made clear today: either everything will go our way, or we will keep fighting.
NATO chief Stoltenberg spoke in the same vein, saying he did not consider Russia's Ukraine proposal "peaceful," so alliance countries will continue to supply arms to the Kiev regime.
