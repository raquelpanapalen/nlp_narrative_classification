Oban laughed at the idea of the United States to grant a new loan to Ukraine

Orban wryly called US plan for new loan to Ukraine magnificent
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban in an interview with HirTV ironically called the US idea to provide a $40 billion loan to Ukraine under guarantees from European countries magnificent.
"The Americans have come up with a magnificent proposal: they will give a new $40 billion to Ukraine and we, the Europeans, will guarantee that the Ukrainians will repay this money," he said.
He said Ukraine is rich in resources but is mired in huge debts, and foreign companies already own its fertile lands and other economic assets.
Orban added that many in the West want to go back to the 1990s, when not only Ukraine was affordable but also Russia, its resources, assets and money, which is why they hope to defeat Russia.
"In fact, Western military leaders want to defeat Russia in the war! But for what, for money, for influence," the Hungarian leader concluded.
Orban has repeatedly harshly criticized the West's actions in the Ukrainian conflict. The US is tightening the conflict because the US military industry is receiving huge orders, even though the majority of the population, including in Europe, wants peace, the Hungarian prime minister believes.
