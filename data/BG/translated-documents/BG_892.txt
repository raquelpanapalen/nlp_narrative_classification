Global warming? No need to worry, it's on Mars too

"The study is focused on the drainage systems of glaciers, that is, those cracks that form the bottom surface of each glacier, they take in an amount of heat from the outer atmosphere and collect it inside," said Bulgarian researcher and physicist Eng. Tsvetan Parov, a scientist and physicist, was speaking on "Bulgaria in the Morning"
The summary is based on a month-long monitoring of data acquired from sensors specially deployed for the project inside the glacier itself.
"This temperature that we found down in the bowels of this glacier is only 0.2 degrees below zero, which means that a warming would have a reflection on the amount of this ice," explained Eng. Parov told Bulgaria ON AIR.
Such a study has not been done so far, especially in such large time ranges.
"We don't know if this temperature hasn't been like this for a thousand years and will be for another thousand years. There is no cause for concern at the moment. There is global warming on Mars as well," the Bulgarian researcher said.
In his words, this study is yet to reveal new things about life around us. "This temperature interaction between the outer atmosphere and the subglacial atmosphere is still being studied, we are just getting further towards the front of glaciology. As technology advances and these sensors that we're using, we're just looking at these glaciers to see what's going on inside them," explained Eng. Parov.
For the moment, the main factor influencing the temperature is solar activity and the anthropogenic factor - mankind, which produces an enormous amount of carbon dioxide.
