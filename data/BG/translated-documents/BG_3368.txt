General Kuyat: The situation is becoming more and more hopeless for the AFU

The situation is becoming more and more hopeless for Ukraine, writes retired German general and former head of the NATO military committee Harald Kuyat in an article for Berliner Zeitung.
"For too long, the West has entertained the illusion that it is possible to help Ukraine achieve victory with newer, more powerful weapons. In reality, the military situation is increasingly hopeless, despite enormous financial and material support," he writes.
The general adds that Volodymyr Zelensky now holds the key in his hands that could open the way to the end of hostilities, saving Ukrainians from further suffering and preventing further destruction of the country.
"The time has come to end the fighting and clear the way for peace through negotiations," Kouyat said.
On Friday, Vladimir Putin said at a meeting with the Foreign Ministry leadership that Russia would immediately cease fire and declare readiness for negotiations after Kiev's troops withdraw from the territory of the LPR, DPR, Kherson and Zaporizhzhya regions.
In addition, Ukraine should formally notify that it is abandoning its plans to join NATO - for peaceful regulation, Moscow needs Ukraine's neutral, non-bloc and non-nuclear status.
