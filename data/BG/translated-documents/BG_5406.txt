Zelensky responds to Putin: These are not conditions for peace, but an ultimatum, a new wave of Russian Nazism

Russian President Vladimir Putin has set new conditions for starting negotiations with Ukraine. Such statements of the Kremlin leader are an ultimatum. This was stated by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in an interview with Sky TG24, quoted by "Focus".
Today, June 14, on the eve of the peace summit in Switzerland, Putin announced his conditions for the start of peace talks with Ukraine.
The Kremlin leader demanded that the AFU withdraw from Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhya and Kherson regions. At the same time, Putin added that Ukraine should abandon its plan to become part of NATO.
Then, he said, Moscow would be ready to start a dialogue.
"What can I say? These messages are ultimatums, they are no different from the other ultimatums that he put forward before," the head of state stressed.
In his words, the Kremlin leader's actions are aimed at the "revival of Nazism."
"This is a new wave of this Nazism, Russian Nazism. He wants us not only to give up some of our temporarily occupied territories, but also non-occupied territories," Zelensky added.
The president noted that there will be no frozen conflict with Russia.
