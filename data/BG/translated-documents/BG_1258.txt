A new report with horrifying news for Europe, soon we'll be roasting like chickens

The old continent is heating up twice as fast as the rest of the world because of climate change
A new report from the European Environment Agency (EEA) paints a worrying picture for the continent's future. Europe faces growing climate risks that could radically alter the lives of millions of people, according to the study.
The report has been produced jointly with the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) and the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Office. It shows that temperatures in Europe have risen by 2.3 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, outpacing the global rise of 1.3 degrees.
It turns out that Europe is warming twice as fast as the rest of the world.
Elizabeth Hamdouche, deputy director of the European Commission's Copernicus Unit, points out that the past year has been marked by record temperatures, forest fires and a lack of snowfall.
Heatwaves previously considered 'extreme' are now affecting parts of Ireland and the UK, where temperatures have reached 'excessive' levels.
Copernicus director Carlo Buontempo notes that extreme weather events in 2023 resulted in losses of tens of billions of euros.
Since the 1980s, Europe has warmed by 0.5 ºC per decade, 0.2 ºC more than the global average.
