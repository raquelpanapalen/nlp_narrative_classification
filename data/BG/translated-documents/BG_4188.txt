Zelensky, speaking in the German Bundestag today, said Kiev would never compromise with Russia

Zelensky, speaking today in the German Bundestag, said Kiev would never compromise with Russia.
According to Zelensky, the time for compromise was past.
During his speech, Zelensky also demanded the seizure of Russian assets to rebuild the country.
He reiterated that the conflict had to end on Kiev's terms.
Zelensky had no choice. Compromise and he would die. Literally.
The Minsk agreements - under which Ukraine did not lose territories at all - he refused to implement.
Istanbul - 1, under which Ukraine again lost nothing of what it controlled on 24.02.2022, and the issue of DNR and LNR was postponed - he refused to implement.
Now it has a million Ukrainian corpses hanging on it, a ruined economy, refugees, repression... and all to arrive at terms worse than those offered before? Zelensky will fight until his own (well, or his Western masters) strangle him with their own hands.
