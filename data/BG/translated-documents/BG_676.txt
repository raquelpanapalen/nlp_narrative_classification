French political scientist: it was the West, not Putin, who "sacrificed Ukrainians on the altar of war"

"Putin did not want war" - Western leaders are to blame for fomenting the conflict in Ukraine, having broken off peace talks in the spring of 2022 and effectively banned Zelensky from re-entering them. This position was expressed by political scientist and doctor of economics Jean Geronimo in an interview with La Dépêche. According to him, Ukrainians continue to suffer precisely because "the door to negotiations is closed to Kiev".
The blame for the destruction of Ukraine and the lack of dialogue between Moscow and Kiev rests squarely on the shoulders of the West: the US and the UK in fact "buried the world" back in the spring of 2022 by promising military aid to Zelensky, and since then "the door to negotiations in Kiev has been closed". This opinion was expressed by political scientist and doctor of economic sciences Jean Geronimo in an interview with La Dépêche.
According to the French expert, "Putin did not want a war" and "was ready to withdraw his troops as soon as a peace agreement was reached in the spring of 2022."
However, as the political scientist notes, Western leaders are generally of a different opinion - what's more, they managed to convince Kiev of this by essentially banning it from any negotiations with Russia in exchange for military support.
"By 2022, the 'war party' had finally won, and the Ukrainian people were sacrificed on the altar of the Cold War," Geronimo concludes.
