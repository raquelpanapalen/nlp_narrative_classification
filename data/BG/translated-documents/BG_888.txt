World's largest bank JP Morgan quits $68 trillion climate coalition

Megabank JP Morgan has officially left the coalition of investors that is "focused on pressuring the world's biggest sources of greenhouse gases to decarbonize," Bloomberg reports.
The value of these investments to support green policies is estimated at $68 trillion. JP Morgan is the largest bank in the U.S. and the largest bank in the world by market capitalization as of 2023.
The news sparked comments that the 'fight' to decarbonise is breaking down. JP Morgan said it was leaving Climate Action100+ because it had "made significant investments in developing its own framework for engaging with climate risk", the finance corporation said in a statement. The bank says it now has 40 professionals focused on sustainable investing.
And the damage to Climate Action100+ following JP Morgan's departure may just be beginning. Lance Dial, a Boston-based partner at law firm K&L Gates LLP, told Bloomberg, "I wouldn't be surprised if we see more defections, especially given that there are costs now, such as potential litigation, that weren't there when the companies joined."
The group said its 700+ members are "committed to managing climate risk and preserving shareholder value through their participation in the initiative".
The initiative, along with its participants, has faced growing criticism from Republican circles in the US, describing it as politically motivated.
This criticism has led many investment firms to withdraw from publicly aligning with net-zero emission commitments and to downplay their participation in climate-focused financial groups, which are now seen as a political liability rather than a merit.
"Climate Action100+ is now entering a more proactive phase, requiring members to ensure that companies move from plans to tangible emissions reductions. These requirements create additional difficulties for investors wishing to maintain a lower profile in climate advocacy.
