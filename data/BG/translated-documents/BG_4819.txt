Ukrainian President V. Zelensky said that the plan to end the war in Ukraine will be ready this year. He said this at a joint press conference with Slovenian President Natasha Pirc Musar in Kiev, commenting on what needs to happen for Kiev to start peace talks, Ukrinform reports.
At the same time, Zelensky noted that not everything depended on his country alone, but stressed that Ukraine would decide when negotiations with the Russian Federation would begin.
"Of course, Ukraine will decide. But if everything depended only on Ukraine, there would be no war. Unfortunately, the occupier is Russia and Putin wanted war. And so far he does not want to end it. But hey, he doesn't want it to end. The diplomatic path chosen by Ukraine is our initiative, because we are a victim in this war," Zelensky said.
He recalled that the peace summit had recently passed, and now three detailed plans on energy, food security and trade were being worked on.
