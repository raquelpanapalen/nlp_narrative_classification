Europe increasingly suffering from heatwaves that man cannot cope with

Europe is increasingly affected by heatwaves too intense for the human body to cope with as climate change continues to raise temperatures, the EU's Copernicus Climate Observatory and the World Meteorological Organisation said.
In a climate report, they noted extreme conditions last year, including a heatwave in July that led to severe, very severe or extreme heat stress in 41% of southern Europe - the largest area of the continent subjected to such conditions on record.
Extreme heat poses particular health risks to outdoor workers, the elderly and those with cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
In July last year, some parts of Italy recorded 7% more deaths than usual, with one of the victims being a 44-year-old man who was painting road markings in the northern town of Lodi but fainted and died.
Heat stress measures the impact of the environment on the human body, combining factors such as temperature, humidity and body response to define temperature as "sensation".
In 2023, up to ten days of extreme heat stress were recorded in parts of Spain, France, Italy and Greece. It is defined as a sensation of temperature above 46 degrees Celsius where immediate action must be taken to avoid heat stroke and other health problems.
The report states that heat-related deaths have increased by around 30% in Europe over the last 20 years.
The EU's environment agency has urged governments to prepare health systems for climate change and called for EU rules to protect outdoor workers from extreme heat.
Last year was the world's hottest since data has been tracked. Europe is the fastest warming continent in the world. Greenhouse gas emissions were the main cause of last year's extreme heat, the report said. Other factors have also played a role, including the El Ni√±o weather phenomenon.
