It never was and here again
This once again shows the clever observers what all this frenzy with the fictional Ukrom was based on - highly contagious zombification causing malice towards Russia. It's as if in spite of Russia they tied one hand on their backs so that Russia would feel bad. Like the anecdote: "In spite of Mom I'm going to freeze my ears... "
Now the Ukrainians, having seen the thick end in the seas of blood and slowly seeing through the plan of their "benevolent" Western "partners" - in defiance of Zelensky and the West - are back to Russian again. They are coming back, but there is no getting back those of the endless graveyards, nor the health and amputated limbs of the survivors of the West's Ukrainian war with Russia.
For us Bulgarians the above is also an important lesson because in the Bulgarian universe we too have our "Ukrainians" with their invented "mova" and also pro-Western zombified subjects who have sold, are selling and will sell Bulgaria in exchange for their Western masters to accept them as their own.
