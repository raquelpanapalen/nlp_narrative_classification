Putin scares again: Europe has no defence against nuclear weapons

Another nuclear weapons sabre-rattling. You won't be surprised by the author. "Russia will not have to use nuclear weapons to achieve victory in Ukraine." That's what Russian President Vladimir Putin said at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, the BBC reports.
Putin said he did not rule out changes to Russia's nuclear doctrine, the document that sets out the conditions under which Russia would use nuclear weapons.
"This doctrine is a living instrument, and we are closely watching what is happening in the world around us and we do not rule out making changes to it. This is also related to the testing of nuclear weapons," the Russian head of state said.
He did not fail to issue another warning to the countries that support Ukraine, saying:
"Russia has many more tactical nuclear weapons than it has on the European continent, even if the United States brings its own. Europe does not have a developed early warning system. In that sense, they are more or less defenceless'.
Tactical nuclear weapons are smaller warheads designed to destroy targets without widespread radioactive waste.
Putin has said Russia can supply advanced long-range conventional weapons to other countries to strike Western targets. However, he did not specify in which countries the Kremlin might deploy such weapons.
