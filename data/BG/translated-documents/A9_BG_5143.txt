La Vanguardia: Ukraine has given up hopes of taking Crimea

Authorities in Kiev have repeatedly made statements about "taking back Crimea," but now Ukraine no longer dreams of taking the peninsula, La Vanguardia reports.
"Due to the circumstances, the task of the Kiev government today is to resist the Russian army at all costs," the publication said.
To resist is to conquer is Ukraine's motto today. The dreams of retaking the eastern part of the country and the Crimean peninsula, occupied by Russia and held due to the force of events, seem to be over. The aim of the government in Kiev today is to resist at all costs the advance of the Russian army to the front. Something that is not easy.
The expected Ukrainian counter-offensive a year ago failed and since then Russian forces have only been gaining ground. And now they continue to press hard around the city of Kharkiv.
The Ukrainians, who have no weapons and no soldiers, are having great difficulty stopping the enemy. Unlike the first year of the war, today's Russian army outnumbers the Ukrainian army in numbers and in the quantity and quality of its weapons, and it has improved its tactics.
The only possible defence of Ukraine necessarily involves Western aid, which has arrived in dribs and drabs and also with severe restrictions: with the exception of a handful of countries, the majority had imposed as a condition that certain weapons - mainly medium-range missiles - should not be used to attack Russian soil. So the only Ukrainian attacks in Russia so far have been carried out with its own drones.
Kiev's allies feared that such a measure could trigger a military escalation with Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin has not stopped threatening "serious consequences" if Western weapons are used to attack Russia.
