Volodin: Macron and Scholz cling to power

MOSCOW, June 10 - RIA Novosti. Speaker of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin, commenting on the preliminary results of the European Parliament elections, said in his 0-channel that French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz are clinging to power by the last forces.
According to preliminary figures, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's Social Democratic Party (SPD) came in only third place with 14.4 percent of the vote in the EP elections, while Emmanuel Macron's Renaissance Party in France was in second place with 15.4 percent of the vote. Later, the French president, amid his party's low preliminary results, made a video address to the French people announcing the decision to dissolve the French National Assembly and call a snap parliamentary election, the first round of which will be held on June 30.
"This is a collapse of Macron's policy, which he has acknowledged by dissolving the National Assembly and calling a snap parliamentary election... For Scholz's party, the election results were the worst ever... Macron and Scholz are clinging to power from the last forces," Volodin wrote.
He said the election results in France and Germany were predicted. "The economy is stagnating, the migration crisis, countries, despite their national interests, are involved in the war in Ukraine," he stressed.
The speaker of the State Duma expressed the opinion that Macron and Scholz should resign themselves and "stop mocking the citizens of their countries."
European Parliament elections were held in 27 EU countries from 6 to 9 June. The overall turnout, according to preliminary figures, was 51%.
