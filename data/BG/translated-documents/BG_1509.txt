About the expensive electricity and the victims of the cold

-4 degrees, feels like -10. It's been dark for an hour and a half. Electricity production from solar panels is zero. On wind it's just above zero.
I often have discussions with green energy fans and coal opponents here and now, right now, in Bulgaria. These folks, whether they understand it or not, are pushing us toward more expensive electricity, economic collapse, and a regime of electricity - because it's entirely possible we won't have anywhere to import from.
They can't answer a few questions for me, so I'm posting them here in the hope that someone smarter will answer.
Can anyone accurately predict how much electricity the entire renewable energy system in Bulgaria will produce tomorrow? I'm looking for accuracy comparable to that of NPP and TPP forecasts for the same period.
Just because someone, somewhere, is indulging their quasi-religious beliefs with taxpayer-subsidized gadgets and has installed solar panels (+batteries), does that mean we should too? A neighbor is watching a bird in his yard, so come on, so are we.
How many people die from coal related diseases in Bulgaria? And how many die of cold? Are the latter more than the former, by a lot? Will the fight for expensive electricity kill Bulgarians?
Belief in man-made global warming is quasi-religious. These people sincerely believe we are "killing the planet". Let them believe it, but why should we go without electricity because of their belief?
