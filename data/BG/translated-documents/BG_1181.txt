SCIENTISTS ALARM: Catastrophic climate change is coming, half of Europe will become the Frozen Kingdom

An untimely halt in ocean currents caused by climate change could plunge large parts of Europe into a deep freeze, according to a sophisticated new computer simulation.
The study, published in Science Advances, suggests that this tipping point in the Atlantic may be closer than previously thought. Average temperatures in large parts of Europe are getting much colder and Arctic ice is spreading much further south.
The nightmare scenario caused by the melting of the Greenland ice sheet due to global warming is still a long way off, but perhaps not as far off as previously thought. The study used a key measurement to track the strength of the vital overall ocean circulation, which is slowing.
If the current - known as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, or AMOC - were to collapse, it would drastically change the weather globally. Temperatures in northwest Europe could drop by between 5 and 15 degrees Celsius, Arctic ice could spread south and global precipitation patterns could change, destroying the Amazon.
"We're getting closer to collapse, but we're not sure exactly how close we are," said lead study author Rene van Westen, a climatologist and oceanographer at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. Increasingly alarming reports on the state of the planet's weather systems in recent months include Friday's news that global warming has exceeded 1.5 degrees Celsius.
