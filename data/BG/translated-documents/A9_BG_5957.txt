BILD: Russians in this place are a "growing disaster"

Neither were they able to take Kharkiv nor create a buffer zone along the border to secure Belgorod
The offensive of Russian troops in the Kharkiv region is becoming an "ever-growing catastrophe," writes German newspaper BILD's military analyst Julian Roepke.
The Russians "have neither succeeded in capturing Kharkiv nor in creating a 'buffer zone' along the border to secure Belgorod. And now, because of the heavy fighting, people and equipment have to be transferred there from other sections of the front," the expert explains.
The situation is worsened by the shortage of armoured vehicles. Every month the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) destroy about 80 tanks and 250 armoured personnel carriers and infantry fighting vehicles.
Russia has no time to make up for these losses. Because of this, supplying the Russian troop group in Volchansk is already difficult.
There is a five-kilometre-long road leading there (on the map), which is under continuous fire from the AFU.
In the absence of armoured vehicles, the Russians are sending civilian equipment over them without adequate protection. Footage has already shown a destroyed Soviet UAZ-2206 van as well as a UAZ-469. According to Roepke, civilian equipment is being thrown into the fighting in the direction of the village of Glubokoye.
