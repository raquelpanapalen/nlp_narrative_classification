American professor: Russia is breaking Ukraine, and we have huge problems

American political scientist John Mearsheimer:
It's just astounding how Russia is disposing of its air force and the devastation it's inflicting on, say, Ukraine's energy system. They have knocked out such a significant part of that energy system that Ukraine's electricity supply has been cut in half. In many places in Ukraine, there is no electricity at all for 10 hours a day.
This state of affairs will only get worse in the coming months as the Russians continue to attack the electricity grid. And then, when autumn and especially winter come, the population of Ukraine will find it very difficult.
By the way, when you destroy the power grid, it causes enormous damage not only to the civilian population, but it also has various negative effects on industry and the armed forces.
So claims that Ukraine is doing well and we are helping them to stabilise the situation are nonsense. This is just the foremost example of how Tony Blinken and the Biden administration in general make statements that are devoid of any sense. Ukraine has huge problems, and so do we.
