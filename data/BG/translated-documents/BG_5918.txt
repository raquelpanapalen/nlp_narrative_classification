Ahmat commander: military operation in Ukraine will end with Russia's victory

The special military operation (SMO) will end in victory for Russian forces by the end of this year. This was announced by the commander of the Akhmat special forces, Major General Apti Alaudinov, on the Solovyov Live program.
"I will say that I stand by my opinion: I am more than confident that this year we will finish the SVO," he stressed
According to Alaudinov, Ukraine's armed forces are trying to control all directions of the front, while Russian forces are conquering new settlements every few days. At the same time, the Akhmat commander pointed out that even after Russia's victory they will want to harm it, but nothing will come out.
According to him, Western weapons will not help Kiev, as there is a critical shortage of personnel in the ranks of Ukraine's armed forces. Consequently, the Ukrainian military is unable to repel the advancing Russian army units.
