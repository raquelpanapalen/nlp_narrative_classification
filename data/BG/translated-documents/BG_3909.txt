Orban: The war can be stopped in 24 hours

The war can be stopped in 24 hours. War is the result of human decisions and it does not matter what leaders the settlements choose. Western countries want to defeat Russia militarily in the conflict in Ukraine in order to gain access to its resources, money and assets, as they tried to do in the 1990s. This is what Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said on 8 June in an interview with HírTV.
He reminded voters that the stakes in the current elections are war or peace.
"Western leaders who are on the war path want to defeat Russia militarily. Their brilliant plan is absolutely simple because it is about money, which gives influence and power," he said when asked why the West wants to defeat Russia in the Ukrainian conflict.
Today, many Westerners would like to go back to those times. They, Orbán continued, "dream of a great reconstruction in the East" and hope that the conflict in Ukraine will make that possible. Moreover, the prime minister noted, some "arms suppliers, creditors, stock speculators" are already trying to profit from this conflict.
