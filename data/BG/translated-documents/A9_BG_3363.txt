Sarkozy's adviser: it is not normal to go to war with a nuclear state

The conflict in Ukraine marked the end of the westernisation of the world and the beginning of a new phase when countries that have long been under the heel of the West want to return to the international arena, said former MP and adviser to Nicolas Sarkozy Henri Gounod. On TVL, he expressed doubts about the wisdom and morality of the proxy war being waged by Kiev's allies with Russia, even though it does not directly threaten anyone.
Henri Gueneau, former MP and adviser to Nicolas Sarkozy: What are the consequences for Europe of this war? To push Russia into the arms of China - is this a good idea for the West and in particular for Europe, which is the most vulnerable part of the West?
Is it wise to widen the ever-deeper gap between the West and the rest of the world - we call it the Global South?
Where is the morality of fighting a proxy war?
They say it forces Europe to be brave, but is waging a proxy war - is that courage?
Or we are in real danger, and then we have to go to war.
But in a war with a nuclear state, one must give the account that it is quite possible that bombs will fly over Paris.
Or there is no danger - and there isn't, notwithstanding the very serious problem at the regional level that they must try to contain and contain.
Nobody in Europe is threatened by Russia.
