Zakharova: Conference in Switzerland on Ukraine has nothing to do with peace

The conference in Switzerland on Ukraine has nothing to do with establishing peace as it brings together arms suppliers to Kiev. This is what Russian Foreign Ministry official Maria Zakharova told reporters on the sidelines of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF), Russian media reported.
"Don't call it a 'peace conference' because it has nothing to do with peace," Zakharova said.
"Those who advocate peace do not supply weapons to the conflict zone. "
"Now you can observe how those who continue to supply arms to a terrorist regime in Kiev are at the same time convening a so-called peace or 'peace formula' conference," Zakharova noted.
"They are doing things that contradict each other. Why is that? Because again they are trying to deceive the international community."
Swiss authorities plan to hold a conference on Ukraine on June 15-16 in the resort of BÃ¼rgenstock. Earlier, the Swiss foreign ministry said Bern had invited more than 160 delegations, including from the Group of Seven, Group of Twenty and BRICS countries. According to Swiss authorities, Russian Federation is not among those invited.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow would not want to attend the conference if it was not wanted there. According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, holding this event is a "road to nowhere"; Russia does not see the West's willingness to conduct business fairly. At the same time, the Russian Federation has repeatedly stressed that Moscow has never refused a peaceful resolution of the conflict with Kiev.
