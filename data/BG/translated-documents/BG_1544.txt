The world's top climate scientists expect global temperatures to rise to at least 2.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels by 2100, "exceeding internationally agreed targets and leading to catastrophic consequences for humanity and the planet," the newspaper reports. "The Guardian" in a front-page story.
According to the publication's survey of scientists from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), almost 80% of them predict global warming of at least 2.5C.
Of these, almost half predict global warming of at least 3C, while only 6% think the internationally agreed limit of 1.5C will be met, the publication continues.
Many scientists are predicting a "semi-dystopian" future, the paper adds, with famine, conflict and mass migration triggered by heatwaves, wildfires, floods and storms "with intensities and frequencies far exceeding those that have already occurred".
Experts expressed their frustration, saying they were left without hope and frightened by the inaction of governments despite clear scientific evidence, the article noted.
In an accompanying story in the "The Guardian, the experts surveyed share more about their views. The article quotes climatologist Ruth Cerezo-Mota, who told the publication, "Sometimes it's almost impossible not to feel hopeless and broken.
After all the floods, fires and droughts in the last three years around the world, all related to climate change, and after the fury of Hurricane Otis in Mexico, my country, I really thought governments were ready to listen to science and act in the interest of the people."
