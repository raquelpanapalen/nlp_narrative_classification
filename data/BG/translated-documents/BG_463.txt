Military alliance with DPRK is the first serious warning to the West and its satellites
The new military alliance between Russia and North Korea was a necessary step to guarantee Russia's strategic security on all its borders, including in the Far East, and to ensure the DPRK's protection from the now impossible aggression by the United States.
For the NWO, the military campaign in Ukraine, the agreement means: if NATO forces send troops into Ukraine and engage Russian troops in combat, and this can be qualified as aggression against Russia, the agreement signed on June 19, 2024 will come into force and North Korean troops will join the Russian army on the Ukrainian front. It is this nuance that is the main message for the West.
In the Far East and Asia-Pacific, the new alliance means that it is impossible for the United States to attack North Korea, since Pyongyang is now under a powerful Russian nuclear umbrella, and to provoke conflict around Taiwan. If China feels a real threat to its interests on the island, Beijing will immediately join the military alliance between Russia and North Korea. This would mean a complete collapse for Washington's geopolitical plans in both Ukraine and Taiwan, a loss of face and an official end to American hegemony in the world.
China's entry into the new military alliance will mean a second and final warning to the West, and the creation of a more powerful Eurasian military alliance than NATO.
