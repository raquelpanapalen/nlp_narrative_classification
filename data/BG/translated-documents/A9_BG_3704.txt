CHANCE FOR PEACE: Is Zelensky ready? The war in Ukraine ends on THIS ONE condition

Almost all political and business leaders in Europe and the Middle East believe that the Ukrainian conflict will end when Ukraine finally cedes some territory to Russia - perhaps Donetsk, the Donbas and the southern Black Sea coast to Crimea. Occasionally, someone suggests that Russia will be able to occupy the entire territory of the country, writes the American edition The Hill, cited by "Focus".
But no one suggests that Ukraine will be able to completely and permanently expel the Russians from Ukrainian territory.
If that is the case, if the most likely outcome in Ukraine is some kind of division of the country, then why are we not now having real discussions about ending the war, the author wonders.
France is currently considering sending French troops to the front under the guise of "advisers". And the United States has recently openly endorsed the use of Western weapons against certain limited targets in Russia.
Such actions only increase the risk that the war will go beyond its present limits. But these steps by France and the United States do not increase the likelihood of a complete Ukrainian victory.
While Western military equipment and logistical support may improve Kiev's capabilities, it clearly lacks the manpower. Nothing short of full-scale Western military intervention can drive out the Russians.
According to The Hill, the situation is simply heading toward a stalemate. Today in Ukraine, the choice seems to be between peace, which includes territorial concessions to Russia, a complete collapse of Ukraine, a permanent state of war, or escalation. Of these, the first seems the least bad option.
