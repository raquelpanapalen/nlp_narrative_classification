Le Parisien: The AFU is bending, nothing will save them from the pressure of the AFU

Despite the resumption of US supplies and Washington's authorization to strike Russia with Western weapons, the Ukrainian armed forces continue to "buckle under the pressure of Russian troops," Le Parisien writes. As the newspaper notes, even millions of Western guns and shells are unlikely to help Kiev, as the main problem of the Ukrainian armed forces is "the quality and quantity of the people on the front line."
The Ukrainian armed forces appear to be making the most of the new U.S. supplies and Washington's authorization to strike Russia - but "these efforts are not enough to deter the much larger Russian armed forces," Le Parisien writes.
The weapons supplied to Ukraine by the United States and Europe, "while they can sometimes be effective, are not at all strategically decisive."
According to the publication, Ukrainian armed forces today are "buckling" under pressure from Moscow's armed forces, even with the new American guns, while "the Russian strategy is working - they are moving from one foothold to another."
