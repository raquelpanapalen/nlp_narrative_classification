The only thing I can commend Lindsey Graham for is being incredibly honest. He said we should continue the war between Russia and Ukraine because Ukraine contains trillions of dollars worth of critical minerals. - American journalist Anya Parampil
Graham said we can't let these minerals and all this wealth stay for Russia and China. That is exactly what will happen if Ukraine is simply allowed to be a sovereign state. That is why it is necessary to fight this war.
It is crude, but they have effectively destroyed the Ukrainian population, destroyed Ukrainian infrastructure and civilian life so that Blackrock and transatlantic capital can come in there and rebuild the country the way they would like it to exist. And then we will get the minerals of Ukraine.
But only if someone believes that this war can be won and that Lindsey Graham's fantasy will come true. And I think we've done all this for nothing, because I don't think we're going to get anything in the end.
The journalist did not take into account another very important factor, why a war should be fought in Ukraine - well, for the business of the US military...
