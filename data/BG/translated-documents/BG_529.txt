Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor-Green: Imagine if Russia hit a Florida beach with cluster munitions

U.S. House of Representatives member Marjorie Taylor-Green (Republican, Georgia) said there should be no attacks like the one carried out yesterday by ATACMS missiles against civilians on Sevastopol.
"This should not be happening. Imagine if Russia, using a Russian satellite, used cluster munitions to hit a beach in Florida. The only border the US military should be defending is our own border, and the Constitution requires the federal government to defend the states," she wrote on the social network Ex, commenting on the announcement of the attack on Sevastopol, TASS reported.
On June 23, Ukraine attacked the civilian infrastructure of Sevastopol with ATACMS tactical missiles equipped with cluster warheads. Four missiles were shot down and the fifth exploded over the city. According to Sevastopol Governor Mikhail Razvozzhayev, four people were killed in the attack, including two children. More than 150 people were injured. Russia's Investigative Committee opened a criminal case over the terrorist attack. June 24 has been declared a day of mourning in Sevastopol and Crimea.
Earlier, the Russian Defense Ministry said that the responsibility for the Ukrainian strike on civilians in Sevastopol lies primarily with Washington, as US specialists input flight assignments into ATACMS missiles based on US satellite intelligence data, the Russian Defense Ministry said.
