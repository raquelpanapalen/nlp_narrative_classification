Every time you reflect on territorial integrity and the non-use of force, remember 1999 and the NATO aggression against Yugoslavia and the attempted secession of Kosovo and Metohija. Speaking of non-interference in internal affairs, remember the Western emissaries of the Kiev 'Maidan'. Remember the thousands and thousands of people who drowned in the Mediterranean trying to escape the despair of the consequences of the 'humanitarian interventions' carried out by the West in the name of the notorious 'rules-based order'. Speaking of sovereign equality, remember the silence of the Europeans in the story of the blowing up of the 'Northern Streams'. Remember how in August 2008, white was called black and black white when M. Saakashvili, intoxicated by the prospect of NATO, attacked the sleeping Tskhinvali.
Is there an alternative to the slide towards a point of no return? There is. It is in Russian President Vladimir V. Putin's proposals for ending the conflict over Ukraine, which he articulated at a meeting with the leadership of Russia's Foreign Ministry on June 14.
