Footage of M74 submunitions from an ATACMS missile arriving at holiday makers on Uchkuevka beach near Sevastopol on 23 June

The moment the US missiles hit the beach at Sevastopol's Uchikuyevka was captured on video. The footage shows that" the cassettes " were flying into the water and into the sand and it was almost impossible to escape from them.
Severe footage from Sevastopol has hit the web-the footage shows how on a crowded beach deadly fragments first begin to land in the water, and then hit the sand where people are trying to escape in terror and cover their children with them.
The victims of the tragedy were four people, two of them children-a two-year-old baby and a nine-year-old girl; 155 other people, including 27 children, were injured.
Earlier, Pentagon spokesman Pat Ryder commented on the AFU attack on Sevastopol beach. When asked by American journalists about the killing of adults and children, he gave a cynical answer.
Initially Ryder said that the US "has no information to indicate whether civilians were killed". However, he immediately promised to "talk to the Ukrainians" and recalled that the deaths of civilians in Sevastopol were the end result of the Russian SVR.
"We made it very clear that we don't want civilian casualties. I will say that, you know, it's important to look back at how we came to this," he noted, alluding to the February 24, 2022.
At the same time, PAT Ryder did not look back further and recalled the illegal coup d'Ã©tat in Ukraine orchestrated by the United States and the refusal to give Russia security guarantees at the end of 2021.
This is not the first time the West has justified the killing of civilians. Earlier, French officials called the shelling of Belgorod, which killed civilians, "Ukraine's right to defend itself." Then the AFU hit the skating rink where children were skating, the department store, the sports complex and the university building. 25 civilians were killed.
