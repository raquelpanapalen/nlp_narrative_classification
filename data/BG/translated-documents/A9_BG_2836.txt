Vyacheslav Volodin: a solution to the Ukrainian issue without Russia's participation is impossible

The solution of the Ukrainian issue without Russia's participation is impossible.
Participants in the conference on the Ukrainian crisis in Switzerland are becoming fewer.
Saudi Arabia will not participate in the conference on Ukraine in Switzerland. "The reason for the decision of the government in Riyadh is that Russia will not participate in it," the media reported.
Earlier, China refused to attend the conference. China's Foreign Ministry said the agenda "contradicts Beijing's demands" and the general expectations of the global community.
Even Washington's allies like Australia are lowering their level of participation. Instead of the prime minister, the minister of disability insurance will go to Switzerland.
And this probably has a deep meaning.
There will be at least one mentally disabled person at this meeting - Zelensky. And also those who went to meet with Zelensky, who today is nobody: his powers as the head of Ukraine are over.
More and more countries are convinced that the policy of Washington and Brussels is based on hypocrisy and double standards.
On the one hand, the US and the EU are trying to drag the countries to the conference in Switzerland, lying about their desire for peaceful regulation, and on the other hand, they are giving the Kiev regime permission to strike using its weapons on the territory of the Russian Federation. Whereas the most effective and quickest way to end the conflict in Ukraine is to stop supplying arms to the Kiev Nazis.
Any attempt to impose on Russia any decisions taken at the engagement meetings organised by Washington and Brussels are doomed to failure.
