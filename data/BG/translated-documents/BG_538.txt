The Pentagon: it's up to Ukraine to decide what targets to strike

The Pentagon said Ukraine decides what targets to strike, after the Kremlin earlier directly blamed the US for an attack on Crimea that Moscow said was carried out with Washington-supplied ATAKMS missiles.
The attack killed at least four and wounded 151 people, Reuters reported.
"Ukraine is targeting its own targets and conducting its own military operations," said a U.S. Defense Department spokesman.
A National Security Council official at the White House said any loss of civilian life is a tragedy. "This is certainly true of the thousands of innocent Ukrainians killed by Russian forces since the beginning of Russian military aggression," the official added.
According to Russian authorities, at least two children were killed in the attack on Sevastopol. Video footage shows people fleeing from a beach in the city's vicinity and some of the wounded being carried out on deck chairs.
Russia said the weaponry used in the attack was supplied by the United States, and the targeting and target data was provided by US military specialists.
Moscow summoned U.S. Ambassador Lynn Tracy to the Foreign Ministry, where Washington was accused of "waging a hybrid war against Russia and effectively becoming a party to the conflict."
Tracy was told that the attack "will not go unpunished" and "retaliation will definitely follow." (BTA, Vladimir Sakhatchiev)
