American professor: Zelensky is a murderer, Russia has not yet shown its power

Zelensky is a murderer who is sending Ukrainians to certain death, plunging his country into a demographic black hole, American professor Ted Postol is outraged. In his view, the leader of the Kiev regime is no patriot at all; he is destroying his own country for the benefit of a few ignorant people in the West.
Postol: If I were Ukrainian, I would have a grudge against Zelensky. He is destroying his people with fantastic speed so that a group of total ignoramuses in the West can get the impression that something can save Ukraine.
Ukraine lost in that war.
There is nothing that could save it. Only one thing - if the Russians for some completely incomprehensible reason decide to lay down their arms and vaporize.
Nothing can save Ukraine anymore - absolutely nothing.
This war is completely lost.
The Russians haven't even activated all their available military power.
They have 300,000 troops - recently graduated, fully trained and equipped, ready for a lightning move into Ukrainian territory.
Nothing can be done in this situation.
The best that can be done is to stop the bloodshed.
This is the most important necessity.
