Britain urged Russia to stop seeing itself as the enemy and replace the West's foolish leaders

Simferopol, June 1 - RIA Novosti Crimea. It is time for the West to replace its "crazy" leaders and stop leading the world towards World War III. This was stated by the leader of the British Heritage Party, David Courtenay.
"Russia is not our enemy. The current insane leaders of the collective West must be replaced by sane people who will de-escalate the Ukrainian conflict and end the rapid movement towards World War III," he wrote on his social network page.
In April, another British politician, George Galloway, admitted that Russia would continue the special military operation while a "river of Western weapons" poured into Kiev and civilians in the Donbas were being shelled with US munitions.
In turn, the former commander of NATO troops, German General Harald Kuyat, stressed that hopes that Ukraine could change the situation in the special operation zone were a fatal mistake by the West.
In the words of Russian Foreign Ministry official Maria Zakharova, the real "peace formula" that will stop the fighting in Ukraine for a few weeks will be the cessation of Western arms supplies to Kiev.
Meanwhile, a Serbian publication published an article this week saying that the West does not need peace in Ukraine under any options. In the event of a victory, this would lead to huge costs for the reconstruction of the country; in the event of a loss, major reputational losses, the article's author argued.
