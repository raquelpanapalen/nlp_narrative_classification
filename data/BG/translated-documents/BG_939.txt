GUILT BY ASSOCIATION SERVES THE GLOBALISTS

In many media today there are publications that the climate was extremely unstable and it was the fault of humans. That is to say, it is our fault that it is raining, snowing, that it is hot, that it is cold and so on. Global warming is waving like a red flag everywhere, even though it is not visible to the naked eye. Science is sitting in a corner somewhere, quietly crying....
Anyone who has studied biology and paid attention in class knows that the history of the planet is full of similar climate changes. There have been centuries of glacial periods /and then humans were just a glimmer in the brain of a monkey trying to pick a banana off the branch/, there have been floods, there was a decade-long cold snap in the Middle Ages that caused a ferocious famine among the population of Europe.
Undoubtedly humans influence the climate by their activities. But not as fatally as the globalists try to tell us. And to make us act irrationally. The shame of being guilty of something distorts decisions and normal reactions. This is why no one asks Ursula von der Leij/n/en why she flies a private jet that pollutes a lot and advertises green energy to us. No one asks what damage is being done to nature by acquiring the elements from which electric cars and wind turbines are made. Nobody asks how wind turbines are destroyed, when they become dilapidated and break down, where they are stored and how long they take to build.
The purpose is clear. The globalists want to reduce population. They tried through the commode, they failed. Now they are trying by reducing energy. Because without energy civilization cannot evolve. They are trying to get us to make the wrong decisions and self-destruct.
I would believe the wishes and good intentions of the leaders of the world if I saw them, for example, going to Davos on foot or on horseback. And if they go to work by bicycle rather than in official cars and planes. The rest is from Lukavia....
