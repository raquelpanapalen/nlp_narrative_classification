Zelensky on Putin's ultimatum : Hitler did it too
This is the same thing Hitler did. Russian President Vladimir Putin's proposal for a ceasefire in Ukraine is an ultimatum and cannot be trusted, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said today.
Earlier today, Putin said Russia would end the war in Ukraine only if Kiev gave up its ambitions to join NATO, relinquished four of its oblasts claimed by Moscow, and demilitarized.
Volodymyr Zelensky told Italian news broadcaster SkyTG24 that he did not think Putin would stop the Russian military offensive if Ukraine accepted the Russian leader's ceasefire offer. Zelensky said this on the sidelines of the G7 leaders' meeting in Italy.
"These are ultimative messages that are no different from those in the past," the Ukrainian president said.
"He will not stop," Zelensky said of Putin, drawing a parallel with German dictator Adolf Hitler's drive for expansion before the outbreak of World War II.
"It's the same thing Hitler did (...) That's why we should not believe these messages," Zelensky pointed out.
