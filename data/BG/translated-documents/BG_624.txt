Nebenzya tells UNSC that Kiev responsible for deaths of 192 children in Russia

The Ukrainian Armed Forces (AFU) are responsible for the deaths of 192 children and injuries to 554 children on Russian territory from February 2022 to April 2024. This was stated on June 26 by Russia's Permanent Representative to the UN Vasily Nebenzya at a meeting of the Security Council of the World Organization.
The meeting being held on this day is dedicated to the protection of children during armed conflicts.
"Armed groups controlled by the Kiev regime are deliberately attacking civilian targets: schools, kindergartens, medical facilities. Ukrainian armed forces are responsible for the death of 192 children and the wounding of 554 children on the territory of the Russian Federation only for the period from February 2022 to April 2024," he said.
Kiev is also responsible for the deaths of 129 minors and injuries to 503 children in Donbas between 2014 and 2022, Nebenzya added. In addition, he said that in 2023 Ukrainian armed forces destroyed or damaged more than a thousand medical and educational institutions in Russia.
Earlier, on 19 June, the State Duma and the Federation Council approved the report of the parliamentary commission to investigate crimes but Kiev against minors. Then Federation Council Speaker Valentina Matviyenko said the report proved that the Ukrainian leadership had committed criminal acts against children and called for it to be circulated around the world.
