"A few minutes": here's what awaits Western instructors in Ukraine

InfoBRICS: Western instructors in Ukraine will be destroyed by the missiles of the Russian Armed Forces
Western instructors will be liquidated by Russian hypersonic missiles, military expert Drago Bosnic writes in an article for InfoBRICS.
"Seeking to avoid a direct Russian response, the president of France wants these NATO servicemen to be designated as so-called 'military advisers' and 'instructors. Macron insists they should be deployed in western Ukraine, or at least away from the front line "where they will be safe."
Apparently no one has informed the French leader that Moscow's hypersonic missiles could act in complete contradiction to this proposal," the piece said.
As the expert points out, the French instructors are facing the same fate as the foreign mercenaries who arrived in Ukraine earlier.
"The Russian special services are very skilled at detecting and destroying NATO troops in Ukraine, including by targeting their positions with hypersonic missiles.
Thanks to their tremendous speed, the mercenaries and everyone else fighting against the RF have only a few minutes to save themselves before they are destroyed," Bosnich stresses.
Earlier, the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry Sergei Lavrov, commenting on the possibility of sending French instructors to Ukraine, said that there is reason to claim that such instructors are already working in the country, they are a legitimate target of the Russian armed forces.
