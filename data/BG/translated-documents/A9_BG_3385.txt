Medvedev: Special operation will help Ukraine free itself from the West's shackles

Ukraine has completely lost its political independence and the special operation will help it to free itself from the neo-colonial shackles of the West. This opinion was expressed by Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev, TASS reported.
"As a result of the coup d'Ã©tat in February 2014, the country completely lost its political subjectivity over the republic, examples of which are countless around the world," he noted in an article published in Rossiyskaya Gazeta.
The Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of the Russian Federation considers it obvious that Ukraine can now free itself from neocolonial shackles only after fulfilling all the tasks of the Security Council.
He noted that for many years it had been generally accepted that neocolonialism existed somewhere far away, for example in Asia, Africa or Latin America. In fact, the politician continued, the ambitions of the new metropolises knew neither economic nor political borders, and the neocolonialists themselves did not want to respect the strategic borders of other countries.
Medvedev said that neocolonialism has long come very close to Russia's borders. The first step was to gain control over Russia's neighbors, including fomenting color revolutions in Ukraine and Georgia, he noted.
"Despite the first setbacks, the West has not abandoned its plans to enslave our neighbors," the deputy chairman of the Russian Security Council summed up, adding that Western countries are focused on creating their own "neocolonial beachhead" on the territory of Ukraine.
