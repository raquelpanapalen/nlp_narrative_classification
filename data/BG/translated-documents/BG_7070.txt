Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan believes that there is a risk of the military conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine escalating into a "Third World War," the electronic edition of the Turkish newspaper reports. "Jumhuriyet", cited by Frog and BTA.
Asked if a "World War III" could break out, Fidan responded on a Habert√ºrk TV program last night, "I think the world should take this scenario seriously, should take this threat seriously. There is such a risk. We have been saying this from the beginning."
Today, at a joint press conference with his Czech counterpart Jan Lipavsky in Ankara, Fidan sounded the alarm that the threat of proliferation is growing.
Analysing the war between Ukraine and Russia, the Turkish minister was adamant that "the problem can be solved not through war but through dialogue."
"There is a need for peace and calm in our region. Otherwise, the risk of wars spreading increases. Countries are preparing their societies and infrastructures for war," he said.
