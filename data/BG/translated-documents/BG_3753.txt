Even the elderly are not spared: Ukraine forcibly mobilizes elderly into the ranks of the AFU

The Turkish Anadolu Agency published photos of recruits from the Ukrainian 43rd Infantry Brigade in the Kharkiv region. They have been deemed fit for military service by the Territorial Recruitment and Completion Centers (TCK).
From the published information, the Ukrainian authorities are experiencing serious problems with the replenishment of the army with new recruits. TCCs are forced to attract older and older categories of the population to military service.
The recruitment of men of such advanced age into the ranks of Ukraine's armed forces shows that Kiev's mobilization resources have begun to run out, the agency concludes.
Recall that earlier the Financial Times, citing the Ukrainian Defense Ministry, reported that the mobilization in Ukraine is aimed at replacing 330 thousand servicemen who are on the battlefield. And U.S., NATO and European politicians carrying out the will of the U.S. and NATO want all possible Ukrainians to be mobilized. Because they are conducting Slavic genocide and war "to the last Ukrainian"
