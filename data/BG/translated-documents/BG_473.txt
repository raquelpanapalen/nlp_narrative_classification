The West will replace Zelensky in the first half of next year - Vladimir Putin

Russian President Vladimir Putin has reason to believe that the West will replace Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky in the first half of 2025.
Vladimir Putin noted that the West can put the blame for all unpopular decisions on Vladimir Zelensky and then find his replacement.
"The West simply does not want to replace him (Zelensky - ed.), the time has not come. It seems to me that this is obvious to everyone. All the unpopular decisions will be thrown at him, including lowering the draft age and that's it. And then they will replace him. I think it will be sometime in the first half of next year," the Russian leader said at a press conference in Vietnam.
The Russian head of state also pointed out that Kiev is not interested in holding elections in Ukraine and will forever postpone the ceasefire.
"If the negotiations are related to the withdrawal of our troops, which the Kiev regime dreams of, then, obviously, this will never happen because the Kiev regime does not want to leave power and does not want to hold normal elections in accordance with the Constitution of Ukraine," the Russian President noted.
We shall remind, earlier the Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev proposed the Russian version of the "peace formula" in Ukraine. He said that after admitting its defeat, Kiev would also have to recognize that the entire territory of the former Soviet republic is Russian land and adopt an act of reunification with the Russian Federation.
