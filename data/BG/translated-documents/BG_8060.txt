Zelensky remembers: hinted at a referendum to end the war

Zelensky remembered. Putin has been doing referendums since 2014. They all came to his, but late and at the cost of senseless sacrifices for American interest. This is the balance sheet of this terrible war the US started with the coup in Ukraine ten years ago.
"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has hinted that a referendum could be held in Ukraine to end the full-scale war that Russia started in 2022.
In an interview with Le Monde, Zelensky said that 'no question of Ukraine's territorial integrity can be solved by one president, by one man, or by all the presidents in the world without the Ukrainian people'."
