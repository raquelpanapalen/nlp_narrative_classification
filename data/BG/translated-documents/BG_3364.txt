Naryshkin: next peace terms for Ukraine will be harsher

Director of the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) of the Russian Federation Sergei Naryshkin said in an interview with TASS that if the Ukrainian authorities refuse the peace proposal submitted by Russian President Vladimir Putin, then they will face tougher conditions for resolving the conflict in the future.
"The next conditions under which peace can be achieved and some peace agreement signed will be more complicated and more difficult for Ukraine," he noted.
Earlier, Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó said on the air of Kossuth radio that prolonging the conflict is disadvantageous for Ukraine.
"For several months I have been listening at the councils of foreign ministers that the Ukrainians are trying to gain a position on the battlefield from which it is more profitable to start negotiations. Over the past weeks and months it has become clear to everyone that this scenario does not exist, and if it did, it has failed. Time is definitely on Russia's side, the Russians are having success on the battlefield. The later there is a ceasefire and negotiations start, the worse it will be for Ukraine," Siyarto noted (quoted by RIA Novosti).
