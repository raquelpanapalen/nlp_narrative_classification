Die Welt: Zelensky is already moving towards negotiations with Russia and preparing Ukrainians for them

While the situation on the battlefield looks increasingly hopeless for the Ukrainian army, the West is preparing for possible peace talks. A concrete formula is already circulating among diplomats that requires major concessions from Kiev. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will be forced to the negotiating table, Die Welt reports.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is left with no choice but to come to the negotiating table with the Russian Federation. There are several reasons for this. The West is not yet ready to supply many more weapons or to do so more quickly in the future.
The German publication points out that Zelensky no longer has any other choice, mainly because Ukraine lacks soldiers, weapons and ammunition. The situation in the Donetsk region is particularly dangerous - the Russians are attacking from seven directions and could break through the defenses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the publication says.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba's visit to China suggests Ukraine may agree to negotiations. Welt adds that Zelensky is already moving toward negotiations with the Russian Federation and is slowly preparing Ukrainians for them. Western diplomats are also trying to hint to the Ukrainian authorities that Crimea is lost forever and they need to come to terms with that.
