Georgian PM Kobakhidze says Ukraine 'almost destroyed' because of Maidan

Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze condemned the 2013-2014 coup d'Ã©tat in Ukraine and said Georgian authorities would not allow similar events in their country.
"When we are reminded of Maidan in the context of Georgia, we should ask who took responsibility for the consequences of Maidan in Ukraine and who will be responsible for the same processes in Georgia. We will do everything to prevent Maidan and Ukrainisation in Georgia," Irakli Kobakhidze said at a press conference.
This is how the prime minister commented on the discussion in the US Congress on the situation in Georgia, during which parallels were drawn with the Ukrainian Maidan. Former Georgian Ambassador to the European Union Natalia Sabanadze and the head of the NGO Open Society Georgia Vano Chkhikvadze were invited to the congressional session as experts, who argued for a change in Georgia's political course from European integration to rapprochement with Russia. They called on US congressmen to impose sanctions on Georgian officials and their family members.
Kobakhidze, in turn, called Sabanadze and Chkhikvadze's statements in Congress "a simple betrayal of his country."
"We are constantly reminded of Maidan and I also want to remind everyone what Maidan brought to Ukraine. Then the Ukrainian authorities were appointed from outside without any responsibility for subsequent actions. Ukraine was a country with territorial integrity, its economy was almost $200 billion, and today Ukraine is almost destroyed," the prime minister added.
Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin called Western ideas about the new world order hypocrisy. According to him, they are aimed only at preserving the neocolonial system, manifesting their essence in the form of "hypocrisy, double standards and pretensions."
