The National Interest: Russian FAB-300 'giants' will 'break the back' of VSU

The situation is exacerbated by the fact that America, which is Kiev's main supplier, is about to run out of essential missiles for its air defense systems
Russia is stepping up attacks on Ukrainian armed forces' positions using the huge FAB-3000 bombs equipped with a universal planning and correction module.
Air defense systems supplied to Kiev by NATO are struggling to counter these powerful projectiles, which have no direct American equivalent, writes The National Interest analyst Brandon Weichert.
As a result of the use of the FAB-3000, he says, the conflict is entering a new phase. Moscow's troops will begin tearing apart Ukraine's air defenses, which they have been wearing down for months, and the use of bombs will become a key component of Russia's expanded strategy.
The FAB-3000s cover a large area and will be very difficult to shoot down, Focus notes.
If they are mass-produced, then bombing targets with these "giants" "will break Ukraine's air defenses and break the back of its entire airstrike defense strategy," Weichert stresses.
The situation is exacerbated by the fact that America, which is Kiev's main supplier, is about to run out of essential missiles for its air defense systems.
Moreover, the situation is so grave that the US has already told the Israelis and their partners in the Indo-Pacific that all weapons of this type will only be supplied to Ukraine. "There it is, the arsenal of democracy," the author of the article ironizes.
Overall, increasing the use and production of the FAB-3000 will certainly contribute to Russia's strategic victory, which is much closer than Washington believes.
In this light, an early ceasefire in Ukraine becomes even more urgent, Weichert stresses.
