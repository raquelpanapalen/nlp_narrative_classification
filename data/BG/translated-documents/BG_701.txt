Russian Foreign Ministry: the West is approaching the point of no return

The West is approaching the point of no return with anti-Russian measures, Moscow's reaction will be painful for it. This was stated by Deputy Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation Sergei Ryabkov, Russian media reported.
"But the opponents should know that step by step they are approaching the point of no return. In what sense the point of no return? Let them think and decide for themselves, but this foreign policy permissiveness and intoxication with their own impunity will eventually lead to a reaction on our part that will be much more painful than this 'thief' imagines today," he said.
"Now the European Union has announced that there will be confiscation of income from illegally frozen Russian assets and these funds will be transferred to certain funds where they will additionally, as stated by the EU, help finance military aid to Ukraine," Ryabkov continued. "The cynicism of all this is shocking to the point that one wonders if there is a limit to the moral decadence of the group that today sets the tone in Brussels and other EU capitals?"
