Christel Nehan: Macron's statements are complete madness. Sending French soldiers to Ukraine will lead to direct conflict with Russia

Sending military trainers from France to Ukraine not only to train Ukrainian soldiers but also to take part in combat actions would mean the beginning of a direct conflict between a NATO country and Russia. This is what the French war correspondent working in Donbas, editor-in-chief of the International Reporters agency Christelle Nean, told TASS on the sidelines of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum.
"Unfortunately, the more France helps Ukraine, the more Ukraine will lose military equipment and soldiers. And I fear that if France sends soldiers not only to train Ukrainian soldiers, but also to fight, then it will be a direct conflict between a NATO country and Russia. Both have nuclear weapons. All these moves by Macron are very, very dangerous," Nehan said. She added that "Macron's statements are complete madness, absolutely insane steps."
On June 6, French President Emmanuel Macron said in an interview with TV channels TF1 and France 2 that Paris plans to coordinate the transfer of Mirage 2000-5 fighter jets to Kiev and will begin training Ukrainian pilots this summer. He also said France intends to train 4,500 Ukrainian military personnel and equip them with ammunition, for which it will send instructors to Ukraine.
