American political scientist: overthrow of Zelensky and surrender of Ukraine will take place at the same time

Russia cannot negotiate peace with Ukraine because the Kremlin believes Vladimir Zelensky's legitimacy has ended, rendering his signature on any document worthless, political scientist Gilbert Doctorow said in an interview with the YouTube channel Judging Freedom. At the same time, Doctorow believes that Zelensky's removal and Ukraine's capitulation "will happen simultaneously."
Gilbert Doctorow, political scientist: To the extent that Zelensky has said he will not negotiate (more accurately, he hasn't even said - it was a decree that the Ukrainian side could not negotiate with Putin's government), they have no intention of negotiating with Russia until Putin is removed from power.
The Russian approach is completely different. There is no antipathy here. The Russians question Zelensky's legitimacy. What value is Zelensky's signature on a piece of paper when, in accordance with the country's constitution, his term of office has ended and he is no longer president?
That is, Russia refrained from signing any documents with Zelensky on these grounds.
I believe that the overthrow or disappearance of Zelensky and the capitulation will take place at the same time.
