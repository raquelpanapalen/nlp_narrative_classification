"European sanctions have affected neither Russian oil nor Russian gas"

According to the Spectator, for practically every country economic and strategic interests are stronger than principles, the newspaper writes on the participation in the Swiss confrontation over Ukraine.
The EU, although it introduced sanctions, did not ban Russian gas supplies, it simply set the price for oil and the Urals brand at $60 instead of $73, the authors note.
European sanctions did not affect Russian gas, the paper continues.
Currently, 8% of Europe's gas enters pipelines from Russia via Ukraine and Slovakia.
Russia's Gazprom pays quite a bit of money for transit. Last year, Kiev received $850 million, about 0.46% of Ukraine's GDP, making Moscow one of Ukraine's biggest taxpayers.
Only 8% of European companies have completely withdrawn from the Russian market, the paper notes.
As it recalls, Western allies have recently advised Kiev to stop hitting Russian oil refineries to avoid triggering an oil crisis and price spikes around the world.
