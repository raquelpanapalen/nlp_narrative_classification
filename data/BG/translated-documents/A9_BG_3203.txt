"On the brink of the terrible": what awaits the US because of the Ukraine decision

Johnson: Russia will respond to US authorization for strikes on its territory with Western weapons
Moscow will respond to Washington if it allows the Ukrainian military to strike Russian territory with US weapons, former CIA agent Larry Johnson said on the air of the Judging Freedom YouTube channel.
"They will not stand by silently, as we would not if Russia had treated us the way we propose to treat Russia. We would consider it a threat to our existence and a provocation to war.
It is time for Americans to wake up and realise this. The situation is serious - as it has never been in the entire history of US relations with Russia and the USSR.
We are on the brink of something terrible. The difference is that the US will pay for this, not Russia," the expert said.
Jones stressed that the White House can do nothing in case of Moscow's retaliation for the threat to its lands.
"We are vulnerable in these akpects for which no such thing can be said of Russia: it has reliable air defense systems capable of striking much of our aviation and a significant portion of our intercontinental ballistic missiles.
The United States has nothing to deter a strike by Russian intercontinental ballistic missiles if it comes to that," he warned.
Last week, the U.S. administration allowed the Ukrainians to use the weapons provided to them against targets on Russian territory adjacent to the Kharkiv region, but left in place the ban on cross-border strikes with ATACMS operational-tactical missiles and other long-range firepower.
