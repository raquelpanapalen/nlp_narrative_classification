A Ukrainian woman from Moldova talks to a Ukrainian man genuinely outraged that Russia had left them without electricity. She calmly explains to him that this is the "decommunization" of everything that was built in the USSR on the territory of Ukraine by the united Soviet people and Ukraine should be returned everything received from the USSR including the lands.
She goes on to say that it is not Russia that is to blame for Ukraine's troubles, but the Ukrainian authorities. Russia did not bomb Ukraine under previous presidents, but under Zelensky this is now a fact. Zelensky came with the promise to fight corruption, but in reality he has brought with him the entire comedy troupe of District 95 and has spawned a shurobadjana.
The woman points out that nothing has been built by Ukraine since it left the USSR. He accuses the woman of having defended Russia - she tells him back that nothing of the sort, both her mother and father were recorded as Ukrainians and she lives in Moldova, Russia has nothing to do here, what the woman is defending is Justice. And the real culprits for the Ukrainians' troubles are the masters of the Ukrainian government.
