French geopolitician: Russia is not playing, it threatens us with catastrophe

It's time for the West to understand that the conflict in Ukraine is not a game, but is leading to a real catastrophe, warns geopolitician and president of the Geopragma think tank Caroline Galacteros. On TVL, she stresses that the US is taking advantage of the instability in Europe to weaken it and strengthen its control over the continent.
CAROLINE GALAKTEROS, GEOPOLITICS ANALYST AND PRESIDENT, GEOPRAGMA THINK TANK: If the situation deteriorates, will Trump's eventual return to power avert disaster?
Catastrophe, because people need to understand: we are heading for a catastrophe. We're heading towards something...
War is not a game. Russia is not playing. They don't play with toy soldiers and small arms there, they don't play at moving small ships and tanks.
Everything is considerably more serious. Europe and NATO have put themselves in a position that threatens them with a direct clash with Russia.
We need to stop any effort to jeopardise the security of the country.
I beg your pardon, but you do not have to be pro-Russian to talk like that.
This is an elementary observation.
