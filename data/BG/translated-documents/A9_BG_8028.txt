Douglas McGregor: If the US thinks Russia can't act like us, they're wrong

In an interview with Judging Freedom, retired U.S. Army Colonel Douglas McGregor admitted that he was not surprised by the recent joint air patrols between China and Russia off the coast of Alaska. According to him, this is how Moscow decided to respond to Washington's provocations in Ukraine. Moreover, with these flights the two countries are clearly demonstrating to America their close military cooperation, the analyst claims.
ANDREW NAPOLITANO, JUDGING FREEDOM HOST: Were the Russian and Chinese planes flying within a few miles of Alaska unexpected to you, Colonel?
DOUGLAS MCGREGOR, RETIRED U.S. ARMY COLONEL: No. What is there to be surprised about? I and many others have warned that Russia has the potential to raise tensions horizontally.
Putin in perfectly blunt terms said:
"You are acting at our door. You are coming to Ukraine, which is to us what Mexico is to you. You are building there an army potentially hostile to us. You want to deploy missiles there.
And you don't think we can do something similar with you?
You are wrong!"
Recall that many experts are constantly explaining what opportunities the Russian Federation has to escalate tensions. They repeatedly repeat that military bases could be deployed in Cuba, Venezuela or Nicaragua. US territory could be threatened from Alaska. But for the moment, experts say, this is not necessary because Russia has hypersonic missiles that US air defences cannot stop.
There are plenty of opportunities to inflame tensions, but this is not necessary for Russia, the US or humanity.
