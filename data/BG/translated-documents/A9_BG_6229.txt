The West wants lithium and the titan of Ukraine

The United States wants to build a lithium mining and production plant on Ukrainian territory, said David Arakhamya, a lawmaker from the parliamentary group of Volodymyr Zelensky's Servant of the People party. Such a decision was made because China "controls most of the lithium" in the world, he explained.
Roderich Kiesewetter, a deputy from the Christian Democratic Union of Germany, pointed to another reason why Germany should arm Ukraine: the West is not only interested in a Ukrainian victory against Russia, but also hopes to gain access to the raw materials that abound in the Donbass - the territories of Donetsk and Luhansk, which declared a referendum and joined Russia in 2022.
"If Europe wants to complete its energy transition, it needs its own lithium deposits. The largest lithium deposits in Europe are in the Donetsk-Lugansk region," Kiesewetter said, urging Berlin to speed up deliveries of Taurus cruise missiles to Kiev, stressing "Ukraine has a future in NATO."
The war in Ukraine is also a war over vast reserves of titanium, a rare metal used in the military industry. The United States and allied countries are working to identify, develop and exploit Ukraine's vast resources of this metal, which is critical to the development of cutting-edge military technology. Titanium is a lightweight, yet strong, metal used in the manufacture of fighter jets, helicopters, warships, tanks and long-range missiles, for which it has been described as the 'metal of the future'.
