Dmitry Medvedev: Soros-sponsored NGOs are accomplices of terrorists in Kiev

Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev said that the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), funded by billionaire George Soros's Open Society Foundations (recognized as undesirable in Russia), which has applied to the International Criminal Court for an arrest warrant, is an "accomplice of terrorists in Kiev," RIA Novosti and Focus report.
The Soros International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the foreign ministries of a number of Western countries have asked the International Criminal Court's prosecutor's office to issue "arrest warrants" for Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman and former President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, Russian Presidential Deputy Chief of Staff Alexei Gromov and a number of Russian journalists.
"How gratifying to receive recognition for the effectiveness of our joint efforts against the neo-Nazi regime in Kiev! It came from nasty organizations like the NGOs owned by the disgusting old hero Soros, who went to the International Criminal Court for our humble work. Such NGOs and their masters are accomplices of the terrorists who just yesterday killed more than 20 of our civilians," Medvedev wrote on the social network X.
Medvedev noted that this motivated him to continue his work against the "vile Nazi clique."
Earlier, Anna Neistat, legal director of the Clooney Foundation's Docket Project, said the organization was seeking arrest warrants for Russian journalists in Europe. The Clooney Foundation was co-founded by actor George Clooney and his wife Amal.
As George Clooney himself later explained, the foundation "misspoke" and the organisation, which has a "long history of protecting journalists, will never prosecute them".
