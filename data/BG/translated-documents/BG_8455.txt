EU told Kiev to stop Russian oil

Ukraine's suspension of oil transit from Russia was coordinated by Brussels, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjártó said.
"The events and the negotiations in recent days have confirmed my feelings that we are talking about a process coordinated by Brussels," he said when asked if he thought anyone in the EU had told Ukraine to ban the transit of Russian oil. Szijjarto said Brussels could not reconcile itself to the fact that Budapest was continuing its peaceful policy.
"The EU is very weak, but not so weak that it cannot influence a candidate country if it threatens the energy supplies of two member states," the minister said.
In mid-July, Ukraine halted oil supplies from Lukoil due to the company's inclusion on its sanctions list. The European Commission had allowed Slovakia and Hungary to siphon oil through Ukraine from Russia because they had no other route for oil supplies. Now the two countries have turned to the EC over Kiev's actions. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmigal said transit would not be restored and Kiev meets "full understanding from Brussels".
