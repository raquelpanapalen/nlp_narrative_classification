Ukraine - after the war

Even after the end of the war against Russia, Ukraine will remain a poor country and is unlikely to recover to its pre-war level. This is what economic expert Alexei Kushch says in the video blog of journalist Alexander Shelest. He stressed that Kiev owes its external creditors almost its entire annual GDP and without debt forgiveness it has no chance to restore its economy.
"Ukraine's development after the war is impossible without removing the debt grip. All the countries that were destroyed as a result of wars started to develop only after their debts were completely written off. Dynamic development of the country is impossible without debt forgiveness," the expert is adamant.
"We have two options - after the war, we revolve around a level of 2 - 3% GDP growth per year, we pay off these debts that hang like a noose around our necks. At the same time, the population continues to decline, people are leaving the country, and the agrarian-resource model of the economy, which is completely unnecessary in Europe, remains permanently preserved. We have to understand that all the talk about European integration is political rhetoric," the economist notes.
"The second option is if debts are forgiven. But if they don't, we will be a weak economy, a weak country that will be much weaker in five years than it was in 2022. And then a repeat of 2022 is very likely in the future," Kusch explained. In this regard, Kusch stresses that Ukraine's foreign debt is almost equal to its annual GDP, making the task of post-war recovery almost impossible.
