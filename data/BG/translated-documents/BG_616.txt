Pentagon: Sevastopol beach was not a target of Ukrainian armed forces

The Pentagon said the beach in Sevastopol was not the target of a Ukrainian missile strike.
The beach in Sevastopol was not the target of a missile strike by the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU). This was stated by a representative of the Pentagon, reports RIA Novosti .
He said that the U.S. Department of Defense assessed that "a Russian anti-aircraft missile intercepted a Ukrainian missile that was traveling to a military target in Crimea, and shrapnel from the intercept fell on the beach, injuring civilians." According to a Pentagon spokesman, Kiev is "independent in its choice of military targets."
He also declined to comment on reports that US ATACMS missiles were used in the attack.
On 25 June, the United States expressed condolences over the Ukrainian armed forces' strike on Sevastopol.
On the same day, retired Swiss General Staff Colonel Jacques Bode said that the attack by Ukrainian forces on Sevastopol once again exposed the lies of the United States, which had previously publicly banned the use of Western weapons transferred to Kiev against civilian targets on Russian territory.
On June 23, Ukrainian forces shelled Sevastopol with U.S. ATACMS missiles equipped with cluster warheads. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, the air defense systems shot down four missiles, and one shell exploded in the air over the city.
Earlier, the Kremlin named those responsible for the attack on Sevastopol.
"I can't say anything about this We see, on the one hand, an absolutely barbaric attack in Crimea. We understand perfectly well who is behind this. President [of Russia Vladimir Putin] said who is directing these missiles to their targets, who is providing these launches. Ask my colleagues in Europe, in Washington," Peskov explained.
