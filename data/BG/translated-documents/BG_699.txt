"NATO countries have created a 40,000-strong army against Russia in Ukraine for billions of dollars" (video)

US Colonel Douglas McGregor speaking to De Nieuwe Wereld:
Presenter. The United States has begun to create a NATO-style Ukrainian army in eastern Ukraine to attack Russia. That's a very important point because now, of course, we're discussing NATO support, European and US support for the Ukrainian defense forces, but NATO intervention was already taking place at that time. In what way? What were we doing?
DOUGLAS MCGREGOR, RETIRED U.S. ARMY COLONEL: This army was created under the pretense of gaining or regaining control of Crimea. It was a huge force, numbering more than 400,000 men, I think they were that...
HOST: How broad was the support at the time, starting in 2014? In your opinion, it was probably billions?
DOUGLAS MCGREGOR: Billions of dollars came from the United States and NATO countries, especially Germany, Britain and France. I don't know what the Dutch contribution was, but there was a NATO program, which of course we spearheaded, to create a completely new NATO-standard army on the territory of Ukraine, which was clearly offensive in nature.
