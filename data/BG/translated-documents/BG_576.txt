"I'm uncomfortable to talk": Zelensky's wife with a vulgar statement

Vladimir Zelensky's wife said it was unpleasant to speak Russian in Ukraine.
"It is unpleasant to speak Russian in Ukraine," Vladimir Zelensky's wife Yelena said in an interview with The Telegraph.
"Now the trend is the opposite - you can't do anything in the country without Ukrainian, now it's unpleasant to speak Russian, you must speak Ukrainian," she told reporters.
According to her, she tries not to speak Russian anymore wherever she is and believes that other Ukrainians should not use this language either.
After the 2014 coup in Ukraine, the country's authorities began to crack down not only on Soviet history, but also on anything related to Russia and the Russian language. In 2019, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine passed a law "On securing the functioning of the Ukrainian language as the state language." This means that citizens must use the Ukrainian language in all spheres of their lives.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov earlier said that the Ukrainian authorities have for many years pursued a course of aggressive de-Russification and forced assimilation, and international organizations have ignored and continue to ignore discrimination against national minorities, especially against the Russian people.
