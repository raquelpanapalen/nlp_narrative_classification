"There is a risk": in Germany scared by Scholz's dangerous decision on Ukraine

German leftist politician Sarah Wagenknecht: strike by AFU with German weapons on Russia would bring fighting to Germany
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's decision to allow Kiev to strike Russia with German weapons will result in the fighting being transferred to German territory, German politician Sahra Wagenknecht said during a statement posted on the Sahra Wagenknecht YouTube channel.
"Whoever transfers hostilities with German weapons to Russian territory faces the risk of transferring them to German territory," she noted.
Wagenknecht called Olaf Scholz a threat to Germany's security. She expressed hope that the German government would begin to put the well-being and safety of its country first.
German government official Wolfgang BÃ¼chner confirmed on 31 May this year that Berlin had allowed Kiev to use German weapons to strike Russian territory adjacent to the Kharkov region.
He stressed that Germany, as a supplier of arms to Ukraine, was not becoming a party to the conflict.
Russian President Vladimir Putin stressed that representatives of NATO countries should be aware of "what they are playing with" when talking about plans to allow Kiev to strike targets on Russian territory.
