Bezos' new $1 billion initiative: eating fake meat to save the climate

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is pouring tens of millions of dollars into developing faux meat as part of the billionaire's $1 billion initiative to tackle the climate impact of food, Bloomberg reports.
Bezos Earth Fund Vice Chair Lauren Sanchez announced this week at a climate conference in Miami Beach that the billionaire's fund will invest $60 million to create "alternative protein" centers.
"We need to feed 10 billion people with healthy and sustainable food in this century while protecting our planet. We can do it, and it will require a lot of innovation. Our world is ready for transformation," Sanchez said.
Bezos' $1 billion initiative aims to transform the global food supply chain with the explanation of "fighting climate change." People are being encouraged to switch from a meat-based diet to faux meat, insects and plant-based foods, as their cultivation does not produce as much carbon emissions.
The new measures to combat climate change have led to mass protests by farmers across Europe. They accused Brussels of trying to kill small farms through draconian measures against 'greenhouse gas pollution'. If the artificial meat project is implemented and people start eating artificial meat, it will mean that many farmers will lose their livelihoods and meat will now be grown in laboratories rather than on farms.
