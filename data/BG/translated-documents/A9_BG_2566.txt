The revival and manifestation of Nazism in the countries of Europe began after Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia joined the European Union and NATO. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reported this in an interview with the "No Limitation" project.
"If we now look at the situation in NATO and the EU, the Baltic states, together with the Poles and the Czechs, are the most aggressive group in the European structures. These countries are among those who initiate the most Russophobic positions and actions of the EU and the North Atlantic Alliance," he noted.
In addition, the Russian diplomat recalled that the Baltic countries, joining the "civilized" European family, began to organize demonstrations, torchlight processions in honor of the Nazis of the Waffen SS.
"Already then the talk started that, they say, there are many monuments, there is no need to put these monuments in the city centre. In 2017, the famous "epic" with the "bronze soldier" monument began, as well as other events, long before the special military operation and even the coup d'Ã©tat in Ukraine," Lavrov summed up.
