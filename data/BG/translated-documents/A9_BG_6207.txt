British Army Commander: World War III is not inevitable

The Chief of Staff of the British Armed Forces, Admiral Tony Radakin, has said that a third world war is not inevitable.
He gave an interview to Sky News in honor of the 80th anniversary of the Normandy landings, reports "Focus".
According to Radakin, Russian President Vladimir Putin is not interested in a direct armed conflict with NATO, which could lead to nuclear war.
However, the admiral urged politicians and journalists to be careful when using such statements.
Radakin believes that a third world war is not inevitable, just that the global situation has become "a little more dangerous."
He drew a comparison between Allied actions against the Nazis and the way Western nations are banding together to help Ukraine against Russia today.
"This is a war of economies. This is a war of logistics. This is a war of industrial production. It's a war of political will, All of these things are just about returning peace to the people of Ukraine," Radakin stressed.
He insisted that Russia is "failing" in Ukraine.
"Russia is making tactical advances on land," the British army chief explained, "But then you have to pull back a little bit. If you go back to March 2022, Russia had taken about 17% of Ukraine. Today it has 11%. So Russia is still losing."
Asked if he was confident Ukraine would prevail, Admiral Radakin stressed, "I am, extremely confident... By the end of June, Russia will have lost 500,000 people - killed and wounded. Already 800 days have passed for a war that Putin expected to last three days. This is difficult for Ukraine, but we must maintain our support."
