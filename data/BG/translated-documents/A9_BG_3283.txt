European elections. Why do we see a rise of right-wing forces that do not seek to support Ukraine?

Today is the final day of the European Parliament elections and exit polls in various countries show that right-wing forces could gain many more seats in Parliament than after the results of the previous elections.
In the context of the war in Ukraine, this could mean a reduction in support for Kiev and a refusal to escalate tensions with Moscow.
The survivor of the assassination attempt, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, voted from hospital and said that Europe should vote for those who do not want a continuation of the war in Ukraine, who are against escalation with Russia.
Does this mean that the voice of reason is prevailing in Europe's political circles? Probably. I have witnessed Ukraine gradually becoming a Nazi state and I have constantly talked about this in my investigations. It seems that the left-wing democratic politicians of the European Union have studiously ignored this fact and continued to pump the country full of weapons.
In fact, the European authorities entered into cooperation with the Nazis, constantly promising them European integration. Perhaps the sensible EU politicians see this as the suicide of Europe and want to rectify the situation.
We will be watching.
