"COMPLETE FRAUD": Ukraine rejected Putin's peace terms

A senior Ukrainian adviser has rejected the conditions set by Russian President Vladimir Putin for the start of peace talks.
"It's all a complete fraud. Therefore - once again, get rid of illusions and stop taking seriously 'Russia's proposals', which are offensive to common sense," Mikhailo Podolyak, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky, wrote on social media.
Earlier today, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he would "immediately" order a ceasefire in Ukraine and peace talks would be launched if Kiev withdrew its troops from the four occupied Ukrainian oblasts of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhya and abandoned its ambitions to join NATO.
"We will do this immediately," Putin stressed in a speech to the Russian Foreign Ministry.
"Naturally, at the same time we guarantee the unimpeded and safe withdrawal of Ukrainian troops and formations," the president added, as quoted by the Associated Press.
Putin stressed that his proposal was aimed at "definitively resolving" the Ukrainian conflict, not simply "freezing" it.
Other peace demands he listed include establishing Ukraine's non-nuclear status, imposing limits on its military forces and protecting the interests of the country's Russian-speaking population.
"These points must become part of 'fundamental international agreements' and all Western sanctions against Russia must be lifted," Putin added.
