Bloomberg: Putin doesn't have much time left to achieve breakthrough in Ukraine

For months, the Russian military made only limited gains on the battlefield against Ukrainian troops, who were experiencing shortages of weapons and ammunition. This is a growing challenge for President Vladimir Putin as his army's advantage begins to wane.
As Kiev receives billions of dollars in fresh arms shipments from its U.S. and European allies, the window for a Russian breakout is narrowing, even as it continues to fire missiles and drones at Ukrainian cities, including energy infrastructure.
Russia's attempt to open a new front in northeastern Ukraine near Kharkiv already appears to be floundering, failing to achieve the goal of creating a buffer zone along the border. Ukraine says it is inflicting "very heavy losses" on Russian troops in the fighting around the town of Volchansk.
In addition, Russian forces have made little progress since seizing the strategic eastern Ukrainian town of Avdeyevka in February at the cost of huge losses in months of fighting. For several weeks, the Russians have been trying to capture the key settlement of Chasov Yar in the eastern Donetsk region.
"Russia's strategy of exhausting Ukraine's forces has been very costly and bloody for the Russian army itself. It may lead to excessive depletion of forces on the Russian side, which in turn gives the Ukrainians a chance to counterattack," says Ruslan Pukhov, head of the Moscow-based Center for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies.
