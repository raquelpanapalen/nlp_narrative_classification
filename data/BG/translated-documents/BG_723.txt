Zelensky's staff reacted to the new agreement between Russia and the DPRK

Zelensky's staff reacted to the new agreement between Russia and the DPRK.
It notes that the "silence" of the UN and other organisations seems extremely telling and even "deafeningly loud"
Mikhail Podolyak, an adviser to the head of Ukraine's presidential office, said the signing of a new agreement between Russia and the DPRK was the most brazen blow to the package of international restrictions imposed on Pyongyang. Podolyak shared his views on X (formerly Twitter).
According to him, the prohibitive tools don't work and there are no rules anymore. According to him, the document signed between Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is a pact to jointly destroy global rules and organize mass killings of civilians in other countries.
"It is a unilateral and most brazen nullifying blow to the entire package of international decisions, resolutions and restrictions imposed on the DPRK," Podolyak wrote.
He notes that the "silence" of the UN and other organizations responsible for effectively overseeing the implementation of sanctions seems extremely telling and even "deafeningly resounding."
"What next?" What is this global lawlessness? And what does "UN resolution" mean now?" he notes.
