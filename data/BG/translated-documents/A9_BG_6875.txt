Orbán: Brussels bureaucrats want this war, consider it theirs and want to defeat Russia

The leadership of the European Union is trying to involve the countries of the community in the war in Ukraine so that Russia can be defeated, even though Europe is suffering only losses from this and does not have the strength and means to do so. This opinion was expressed by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban in an article published in the Magyar Nemzet newspaper, TASS reports.
He noted that now Europeans "are facing war, migration and stagnation instead of peace, order and development." "The situation is worsened by the fact that the Brussels bureaucracy, living in a bubble, has made a number of extremely bad policy decisions in recent years. Europe is increasingly involved in a war in which the continent has nothing to gain but everything to lose," the Hungarian prime minister noted.
According to him, the EU leadership in Brussels "does not regret the losses suffered so far from this war". "The Brussels bureaucrats want this war, they consider it theirs and they want to defeat Russia. European citizens' money is continuously pouring into Ukraine, sanctions have hit European companies, led to rising inflation and deprived millions of Europeans of their livelihoods, but believe me - no one in Brussels regrets it," Orban wrote.
"Suddenly everyone has forgotten about the transition to a green economy. Today Europe uses more coal and energy prices are higher than five years ago. European farmers are protesting against daily losses, while Ukrainian agricultural products of dubious quality are sold at dumping prices without restrictions," Viktor Orbán pointed out.
"The very fact of the crisis and the escalation of the military situation, long before the European Parliament elections, has clearly shown that Europe needs change," Orban concluded.
