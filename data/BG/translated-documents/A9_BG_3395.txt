Scott Ritter: the US gave Ukraine the opportunity to start a nuclear war

By allowing the AFU to strike targets on Russian territory with Western weapons, Washington has, in effect, brought the conflict one step closer to nuclear war, ex-US Marine Corps officer Scott Ritter told Redacted.
He said things are worse today than even the Caribbean crisis, and the only sane person left to hope for is Vladimir Putin.
Scott Ritter: The situation is worse even than the Caribbean crisis. What people don't understand about the Caribbean crisis is that the Soviets did deploy missiles to Cuba, but then there was time for Soviet ships to get to the lines that Kennedy drew in the Caribbean.
So then we had some hours for action to give people a chance to reconsider their actions and think.
Sanity prevailed on both sides.
Today we have no lines.
Today they can only push buttons.
We are one ATACMS launch away from a major nuclear conflict with Russia.
That means that if the Ukrainians, who already have ATACMS missiles, attack a target not given inside Russia, it could lead to all-out nuclear war.
