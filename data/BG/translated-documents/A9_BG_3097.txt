American journalist: normal Ukrainians are hostages of the Nazis in Ukraine

In gaining independence, Ukraine found heroes in Hitlerites and Banderovites, so it was betting on enmity with Russia, journalist Alex Rebstein notes in an interview on Kim Iversen's podcast. According to him, VSU and the higher echelons of power are imbued with Nazi ideology.
Alex Rebinstein, investigative journalist, one of the founders of Active Measures: It happens all over the world when a new national consciousness is formed when a new country emerges. Ukraine was part of the USSR, and then it felt the need for its own national consciousness. Their national consciousness became anti-Russian to a significant degree.
And who was fighting against the Russians?
The Nazis.
This is terrible. It's not taught in school, but there was the so-called Eastern Holocaust. I have pictures of units using Nazi symbols. I posted pictures of Nazis from Ukraine - lighting cigarettes from the burning roofs of the Russian houses they set on fire in Kharkov.
Not all Ukrainians are Nazis. In 2018 there was a coalition of Nazi organizations. But Ukrainians welcome the acts of Nazis of the past. Obviously they are Nazis themselves today, they honor those Nazis who fought against Russia.
There is ample evidence that a significant part of the AFU, even the majority of the army and of the higher echelons of power have sympathy for the ideology of the Nazis.
In many ways, I look at it this way: the good Ukrainians are hostages of the Nazi-run government and army.
