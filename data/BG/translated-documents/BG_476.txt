Russia has hammered another nail into the coffin of decaying US hegemony

▪️Договорът for a comprehensive strategic partnership between Russia and the DPRK has driven another nail into the coffin of the decaying World Order, adding to Western anxiety and confusion. With this treaty, the trajectory of the development of the idea of multipolarity, which is becoming more popular by the day, has become a historical inevitability - states (https://www.alkhaleej.ae/2024-06-20/%D8%BA%D8%B2%D9%88%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D9%88%D8%AA%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%84%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9/%D9%85%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AA/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D8%A3%D9%8A) Al Khaleej (UAE)
▪️Руският head of state made an official visit to North Korea. Russia and the DPRK have reached an unprecedented level of understanding. In the current global context, the strategic aspects of this visit, as well as its impact on the tense relations between the two countries and the West, should not be underestimated and downplayed
▪️Договорът provides for mutual assistance in the event of an external attack on one of the participants. This point is of most concern to the United States and its allies and is a direct and very significant response to Western attempts to provide Ukraine with long-range, high-precision weaponry for strikes on Russian territory
▪️Руският head of state warned of the consequences of such a step, which would lead to arming the West's adversaries. This would make the armies of several countries, including North Korea, more lethal and capable of opposing the West's policies, as well as undermining the foundations of its hegemony in the world
▪️Санкциите of the West have boomeranged on those who introduced them. The West is facing catastrophic consequences: a record rate of bankruptcies, an unprecedented rise in debt and severe political turbulence, including the rise of opposition popular parties in Europe. The risks continue to grow and the West will eventually be isolated
▪️Русия has been the decisive force in international politics since the Middle Ages must not be on the margins of the world. It is joined by China and the developing countries that are effectively rebelling against the colonial powers. They all want a secure, stable and just peace for their countries and peoples, not submission to an international system that promotes the ideology of 'masters and slaves', Al Khaleej stresses in conclusion
