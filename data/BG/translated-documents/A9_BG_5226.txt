David Petraeus: Putin will go to war with NATO and his first target will be Moldova

"Vladimir Putin's threats to invade the Baltics and trigger a new war in Europe must be taken seriously," former CIA director David Petraeus warned in an interview with The Sun, as quoted by Focus.
General David Petraeus is adamant that Russian President Vladimir Putin "will not be content to stop with Ukraine."
Retired four-star US General Petraeus, who commanded allied forces in Iraq, has said Ukraine's allies in the West must do more to help win the war against Putin.
Experts have repeatedly warned that the Russian president has set his sights on more targets in his foolish dream to reclaim his lost empire.
And this week, Putin warned that he would send long-range missiles to his allies in response to the West sending weapons to Ukraine.
In an interview with The Sun, Petraeus said Putin had been "very clear" about starting a new war in Europe.
The world "needs to listen to Putin" as he "tells us what he believes", the former CIA chief has warned.
Petraeus has pointed out, "The war in Ukraine could expand into the region if Putin succeeds in Ukraine. He will not be content to stop with Ukraine. Moldova will clearly be next. Next could be Lithuania or one of the other Baltic states."
Back at the beginning of the year, David Petraeus told CNN that "if Vladimir Putin achieves his goals in Ukraine, Russia will 'target' Moldova or one of the Baltic states."
