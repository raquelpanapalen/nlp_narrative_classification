Atrocity! The Russians began to cut heads on the front

This is the latest accusation of atrocity made by Ukrainian prosecutors against Moscow
Kiev has accused Russian forces of beheading a Ukrainian serviceman in the eastern Donetsk region, the latest accusation of atrocity leveled by Ukrainian prosecutors at Moscow.
"While conducting an aerial reconnaissance of one of the fighting positions in Donetsk region, the Ukrainian military discovered a damaged Ukrainian Defense Forces armored vehicle. It contained the severed head of a Ukrainian defender," the office of Ukraine's Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin said on social media.
"We have received information that Russian commanders issued orders that Ukrainian servicemen should not be captured, but killed with inhuman cruelty - by beheading," he was quoted by UNIAN as saying.
Such an act, he said, is "a terrible barbarity that has no place in the 21st century."
"And this is further proof that the war crimes committed by the Russians are not isolated incidents, but a planned strategy of the Russian regime. These criminal orders were given at the level of the battalion and company leadership of the occupation troops," added Ukraine's chief prosecutor.
Earlier, the commissioner of the Verkhovna Rada on human rights Dmytro Lubynets said that the Russians committed war crimes against Ukrainian prisoners of war. According to him, there are many such cases.
"Actually, the cases, executions, beatings or torture of our prisoners of war that become public are a small part of the data I receive every day. A very small part. A lot of work has been done to identify every member of the Russian army.
