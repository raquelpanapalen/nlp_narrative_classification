Medvedev colorfully described the participants in the meeting in Switzerland about Ukraine

None of the participants in the summit in Switzerland to resolve the situation in Ukraine know what he is doing there and what his role is, Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev wrote on his Telegram channel.
In the post, Medvedev compared the "peaceful" summit in Switzerland to George Orwell's Animal Farm.
"This Swiss 'animal farm' is pure surrealism. Kafka and Orwell are nervously smoking on the sidelines. None of the participants in the 'peace forum' know what he is doing there and what his role is," Medvedev wrote.
In his words, to "resolve the conflict," the Swiss shepherds called in only vetted animals: "the foolish little boar with his invariable friend, a herd of blissfully bleating Western alpine rams, and also a pack of European cattle guard dogs."
"The dogs bark, spray venomous saliva on all sides, and keep order. It has to be watched for: the sheep often bleat not where they should and get confused in rote formulations," Medvedev wrote.
