Jeffrey Sachs: For its prosperity, Europe must rebuild ties with Russia

For the sake of its prosperity, Europe must rebuild its ties with Russia. This is what the American economist Jeffrey Sachs said in an interview with L'AntiDiplomatico. "By adopting an anti-Russian course, the EU has given up its autonomy. But European leaders must work for the good of peace."
Asked how the world ended up on the brink of potential war, Sachs replied, "America has had five successive presidents (Clinton, Bush, Obama, Trump, Biden), each of whom has brought us closer to nuclear war. "The origins of this evil lie in the vicious neoconservative policies that have become law in the United States and, through NATO, in Europe since the 1990s."
"Europe has given up its security, autonomy and economic well-being by obediently submitting to the United States," the professor argues. The conflict in Ukraine after the Maidan coup led to the fact that the countries of the European continent became full protectorates of Washington, cutting off all economic and trade ties with Moscow - the most important source of possible independence and self-determination.
The terrorist attack on the Nord Stream gas pipelines is the biggest attack on Europe's logistical infrastructure since the end of the Second World War, which has become a point of no return, according to the professor.
"But the appetites of the neoconservatives cannot be satisfied. Therefore, to maintain unilateral power in a world that is becoming multipolar due to entropy, they are leading us to extreme escalation. We see this not only in Ukraine, but also in the Middle East and in the recent attacks on Venezuelan sovereignty," says Sachs.
"Change is not going to come from the United States. Change has to come from Europe," Sachs insists.
