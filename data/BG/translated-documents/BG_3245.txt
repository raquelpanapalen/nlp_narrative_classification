Western support for Kiev no longer seems unshakeable

On the 80th anniversary of the Allied landing in Normandy, the conflict in Ukraine continues amid instability on the Western front.
At the commemorative events, the leaders of Western countries will demonstrate a united front: they will lay wreaths at the graves of the dead and pledge unwavering support to Kiev. But the mood on the battlefields of Ukraine and the sweeping changes in global politics suggest otherwise.
The West's support, which until this year provided arms supplies to Kiev, no longer seems unshakable.
Promises of support and solidarity with Ukraine may prove hollow as the world prepares for potential seismic shifts. Europeans fear that if Biden loses to Trump in the fight for the White House this autumn, Ukraine could lose its most important ally.
And even if Joe Biden is re-elected, not all members of his administration will want to join forces with Ukraine and spearhead a victorious counter-offensive against Russia, said French political scientist Nicolas Tenser.
Meanwhile, across Europe, mainstream parties fear that the far right could win a big victory in this week's European Parliament elections.
