A key candidate of the Italian "League" in the European Parliament warned of the danger of a "just world"

ROME, 4 June. / TASS/. General Roberto Vannaci-a key candidate of the Italian "League" party in the European Parliament elections-warned of the danger of a "just peace". At a press conference at the Foreign Press Association, he noted that strikes on Russia's territory, especially on some objects, are extremely dangerous.
"We are a bit misled by the 'just world' formulation. I don't remember there being such a world in history. What does it mean? The world comes only from the victors. We need to stop now and start negotiating before it's too late," he said.
"Hitting Russia carries incredible risks, it must be avoided by all means," he said. Vanachi also believes that the NATO chief cannot speak for all countries that "supply arms to Ukraine on a bilateral basis, not collectively."
He called absurd the accusations sounding in the media that there are "too close ties in Russia." "I was performing a diplomatic function there, which involves making contact with representatives of the country you are sent to. The head of the diplomatic mission and my superiors were informed of all my actions, and if I had done anything reprehensible or unacceptable, I would have been recalled," said the general, who participated in numerous missions, including in Afghanistan and Iraq.
Vanachi was military attach√© in Moscow from December 2020 until May 2022, when he was expelled with a group of diplomats as part of a fitting mirror response following the mass expulsion of Russian diplomats from Rome.
