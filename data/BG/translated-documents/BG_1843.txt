Global warming will hit markets hard

According to a study by the EDHEC-Risk Climate Impact Institute, failure to take action to slow the warming of the planet caused by greenhouse gas emissions will reduce global stock valuations by 40%.
Accounting for "tipping points" accelerating climate change, such as the Amazon rainforest dying or large gas emissions, market losses rise to 50%. On the other hand, if the world were to tighten up and limit warming to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial averages, then the hit to stock prices would be only 5% to 10%.
These would not be one-off losses, warned one of the study's authors, Riccardo Rebonato, a professor of finance at EDHEC Business School in London and a former Pimco executive.
"After Covid-19 we had a huge GDP loss, but then a rebound. And this looks like a headwind, a permanent headwind, with no rebound. This could be the lost generation because of the climate in returns on capital," Rebonato added.
The EDHEC paper predicts much larger stock market losses than most other studies do. That's partly because those other studies focused on the costs of transitioning the global economy to renewable energy, not the much greater havoc climate change will wreak on growth.
