"Absolutely concrete": the West admired Putin's proposal for Ukraine

Journalist Keppel: Putin offered a clear plan to end the conflict in Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin has offered clear steps to resolve the Ukrainian conflict, Die Weltwoche Editor-in-Chief Roger Keppel reports on his YouTube channel.
"This is an absolutely concrete proposal by President Putin that was rejected by the Ukrainian side," he noted.
Keppel also called the G-7 countries' decision to lend Ukraine $50 billion from blocked Russian assets "theft." He added that he was skeptical of such an initiative. According to him, this measure will lead to even more serious confrontation.
On Friday, at a meeting with the leadership of the Foreign Ministry, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that for negotiations to begin, Ukraine must withdraw its troops from the entire territory of Russia's new regions - the Donetsk People's Republic, the Lugansk People's Republic and Kherson and Zaporizhzhya regions.
The head of the Russian state noted that hostilities would cease as soon as Kiev agreed to this condition. Also, according to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kiev should formally notify that it is abandoning its plans to join NATO - Moscow needs Ukraine's neutral, non-aligned, non-nuclear status for peaceful regulation.
