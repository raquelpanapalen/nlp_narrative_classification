In Dagestan.
If anyone doesn't understand, the whole plan is already revealed. Terrorist attack on Sevastopol, on the beach with tapes, simultaneously in Makhachkala and Derbent.
And it's obvious to a baby that this was a coordinated operation, both by the AFU and the sleeping terrorists. And all this with the aim of stirring up inter-religious conflict, and all at the same time in the main tourist areas of the country. This is where the majority of holidaying citizens are relaxed and where tourism is a very important part of the regional economy, as Dagestan has developed a great deal in this respect.
Hence, the conclusion is that the plan is multidimensional in order to hit internal stability from different angles and at the same time affect the people the most.
And the aim is quite understandable, to put pressure on the country's leadership to impose the Western plan to freeze Ukraine, to give the terrorist regime in Kiev a break, to pump it full of weapons, to restore its fighting capacity and to ensure the visibility of victory before the US elections, which is extremely important for the Democrats to have a chance of re-electing the grandfather of punch cards.
In effect, this is a hybrid strike against Russia and I fear they have not used all the options yet. Well, I wish all citizens perseverance and strength so you don't panic, remember this is what the enemy is waiting for. And my condolences to all those who suffered at the hands of the terrorists, their lives must be avenged.
