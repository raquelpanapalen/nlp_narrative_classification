Laurence Wilkerson: the conference in Sweden is a complete sham, Zelensky had his questions crossed out (video)
Napolitano: Putin picked an interesting moment for his terms for a cessation of hostilities. 90 countries gather in Geneva, Switzerland. Russia, of course, is not invited to the so-called peace conference. I don't know what they hope to accomplish without Russia.
Russia does not wish to negotiate with Zelensky because he is not the legitimate President of Ukraine and has no legal status whatsoever. I believe that President Putin has spoken clearly, concisely, persuasively, and he has done so very timely.
LAWRENCE WILKERSON, RETIRED U.S. COLONEL: Absolutely correct. By the way, the organizers and those who control the script of this conference have already shortened the list of ten questions that Zelensky submitted for discussion. He can raise them if he wishes, but no one will discuss them.
Two or three topics remain: food security, nuclear safety and the return of the children. These are the three issues they will discuss at this "unlikely" peace conference.
