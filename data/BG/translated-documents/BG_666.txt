"It will crush them with one blow": Russia with a new signal to the West

Daily Mail: Russia has sent a signal to the West over Ukraine nuclear drills
Russia has sent a signal to the West with its nuclear exercises, the Daily Mail reports.
"The latest exercises take place against a backdrop of deep contradictions between Russia and NATO countries ... which has seen relations between East and West reach their lowest point since the Cuban missile crisis in the 1960s," the publication said.
The article notes that Russia has been conducting maneuvers using the Yars mobile ground-launched cruise missile systems. The publication points out that these missiles are capable of reaching speeds of Mach 25 and have a range of flight of 12,000 kilometres, allowing them to strike Europe and the United States.
"A single Yars strike can shred and turn into NOTHING six different targets, with each explosion approximately six times more powerful than the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima," DM writes.
The piece recalls Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov saying that if the West underestimates Moscow's resolve in defending its interests, it could lead to "tragic and fatal" consequences.
Russia's defence ministry said the exercises by non-strategic nuclear forces were aimed at maintaining readiness for the use of nuclear weapons to guarantee the sovereignty of the Allied State of Russia and Belarus. Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov noted that the exercises were normal practice. If certain types of weapons are available, then the Russian armed forces maintain their combat readiness at the necessary level and conduct exercises, he explained.
