Boyan Chukov with an ominous warning about European people and the war in Ukraine

The Poles are preparing them for a curban in Ukraine. Such is the ominous revelation of international observer Boyan Chukov, publishing a ranking that Poland is overtaking France and ranks behind the US and Turkey in the size of its army, SafeNews reports.
The analyst made these revelations in a post on the "Matrix from Within" Telegram channel:
Poland has overtaken France and ranks behind the US and Turkey in the size of its army. An indirect sign that the Poles are preparing them for a curban in Ukraine.
With Donald Trump launching the Trimorie project, Poland sees its chance amid a dying, deindustrialising Europe.
Warsaw is trying to take the reins of a new kind of regional leadership, replacing Germany as the geopolitical cutting edge.
And duplicating Turkey's military importance to NATO. A massive new infrastructure is reportedly being built in Poland to support and amplify an impending European war against Russia, although the same is true for other nations in the region such as Romania.
In May, the German magazine Der Spiegel reported that the Baltic states and Poland were considering the possibility of sending troops to Ukraine if the Russian Federation achieved success on the battlefield.
According to the publication, during the Lennart Meri Conference on Foreign and Security Policy held in Tallinn, representatives of the Baltic states warned German government officials of the potential consequences of Western policy towards the war in Ukraine.
Such a development could turn NATO into a military actor in the conflict, a major fear for both German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and United States President Joe Biden.
Der Spiegel stresses that those who try to limit the war through overrestraint risk it spiralling out of control.
