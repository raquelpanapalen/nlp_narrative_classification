Bosses of the world's biggest oil companies have 'mocked' the green transition

Industry resistance to demands by governments and activists to phase out fossil fuel development intensifies
Executives from the world's leading oil and gas companies have said the transition to clean energy is "visibly failing" and being implemented at an "unrealistic pace" at the annual Cera Week industry summit in Houston, Texas, the Guardian reports.
The article said they condemned calls for a rapid phase-out of fossil fuels, despite broad agreement within the industry, as well as with governments and scientists, on the need to reduce emissions to curb climate change.
The article quotes Amin Nasser, CEO of Saudi Aramco, the world's largest oil company, saying "to the applause of the room," "We need to abandon the fantasy of phasing out oil and gas, and instead invest adequately in them."
The summit comes after oil companies such as BP and Equinor wrote off renewable energy projects and others postponed greenhouse gas reduction targets due to greater uncertainty over the transition to cleaner fuels, Reuters reports.
Taken together with the strong demand for oil at the moment, this has "intensified industry resistance to demands by governments and activists to phase out fossil fuel development," the article noted.
John Podesta, Biden's chief climate adviser, attended Serra Week and gave the industry "mixed marks on the energy transition," Axios reports.
Separately, S&P Global reports, "Senior U.S. Republican lawmakers attacked the International Energy Agency in a sharply worded March 20 letter to its executive director, Fatih Birol."
The publication quotes the letter as saying: 'We contend that in recent years the IEA has undermined energy security by discouraging sufficient investment in energy supplies - specifically oil, natural gas and coal.
