Putin's voice: No preconditions for peace talks with Ukraine

At the moment, there are no preconditions for peace talks between Moscow and Kiev, Ukraine itself has closed the door to this.
This was said by the press secretary of the Russian President Dmitry Peskov, in an interview with Izvestia, quoted by TASS.
"At the moment there are no grounds for starting the negotiation process. The Kiev regime has still completely closed all doors to the negotiation process. We continue to achieve our goals through a special military operation," he said.
Recall that Moscow has repeated several times that it no longer accepts Volodymyr Zelensky as Ukraine's legitimate president due to the expiration of his term, although Kiev has explained why no elections have been held in the country.
Ukraine also did not include Russia in the peace conference in Switzerland due to take place in June.
Strikes against the Russian Federation involving Western countries mean direct war, to which Moscow will respond. This was stated by Russian President Vladimir Putin at a meeting organized by TASS with heads of world news agencies.
Russian weapons could be supplied to any of the enemies of the United States of America as a symmetrical response to arming Ukraine against Russian Federation. This was stated by Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev
