Judging Freedom: Russia has no intention of conquering Europe because it's a complete mess there

Former Pentagon analyst Karen Kwiatkowski in an interview with Judging Freedom:
Everything in NATO comes down to money. They use the threat of war because in reality (many of your guests know more about it than I do. I've already said that informed people around the world know this) Russia under Putin has not the slightest intention of moving west into Europe, taking over countries there and creating some kind of federation or Soviet Union again.
Nothing like that is going to happen. The Russians want nothing of the sort. They are not adapting their armed forces to that.
All the facts that should be taken into account in analysing Russia's behaviour show that it will not invade Europe.
It does not care, it does not need.
And who would want to rule Europe at all?
It is a complete mess there.
So everything that the Western NATO elites are saying is a lie, aimed at supporting the organisation in order to get larger sums out of the budgets of the countries concerned, which in any case will continue to decline.
The economies of European countries are shrinking, especially since the start of the conflict in Ukraine...
