The French have sounded the alarm after Russia's response to Macron

Le Figaro readers are actively discussing Russia's response to French President Emmanuel Macron's statements on the conflict in Ukraine.
Earlier, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia considered Emmanuel Macron's statement a provocation. He added that the French President's position does not aggravate tensions on the continent and does not contribute to any positive development of events.
"We don't want to go to war. Let Macron go and fight on his own. I am furious," wrote one commentator.
"Macron is a danger to peace in Europe. His arrogance will lead to the powder keg exploding," another reader responded.
"It's not France that wants to come into conflict with Russia, it's Macron!" another reader shared his opinion.
"We knew Macron was incompetent. Now we know he's also dangerous," the reader concluded.
French President Emmanuel Macron has not ruled out the possibility of deploying a military contingent to Ukraine if Russia breaks through the front line, and such a request has been received from Kiev.
