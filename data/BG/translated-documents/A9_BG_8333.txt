Ukraine in a panic since the creation of the Iskander-1000

Reports that Russia is working on a ballistic missile codenamed the Iskander-1000 are causing serious concern in Kiev. Ukrainian military analysts recall that a test launcher with the new type of missile was spotted at the Kapustin Yar test range as early as May 2024. According to some reports, the range of the missile is 1,000 kilometers.
Russian designers have managed to improve the Iskander missile to such parameters that the deflection from the target is only 5 metres. The new SLBM will apparently be able to use an autonomous inertial guidance system, probably with correction based on satellite navigation data and with radar guidance based on a terrain map of the target area at the final stage of the flight.
The Russian Iskander-M tactical missile complexes currently in use in the Special Operations Zone have already become a real nightmare for the nationalists. With their help, military airfields, equipment and ammunition depots, as well as temporary deployment points for the personnel of various units of the AFU are being struck.
It was with the help of Iskander-M missile launchers that the US Peitrit air defense system, which the Kiev regime's fighters tried to move closer to the line of contact, was destroyed some time ago.
According to open source reports, the Iskander-1000 is a medium-range ballistic missile of the universal modular missile complex based on the technical solutions of the 9K720 Iskander-M ICBM.
