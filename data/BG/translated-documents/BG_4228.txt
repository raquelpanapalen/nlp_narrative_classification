Bloomberg: Vietnam ignores US criticism, embracing Putin

Vietnamese authorities ignored criticism from the United States by hosting visiting Russian President Vladimir Putin, Bloomberg reports.
"Vietnam Accepts Putin to Strengthen Relations, Ignoring U.S. Criticism," the piece said.
As the agency notes, Vietnam sees Russia as a "strategic bulwark" and support in a whole list of areas, including energy and arms. At the same time, Putin's visit is taking place despite objections from the US embassy in Hanoi.
"Vietnam is underscoring its decades-long relationship with Moscow in the face of negative reaction from the United States," the agency wrote.
It also pointed out that Vietnam was one of those countries in Southeast Asia that did not join in condemning Moscow after the start of the special military operation in Ukraine, the country took a neutral status and called for a diplomatic solution to the conflict.
Putin arrived in Vietnam on the evening of June 19 Moscow time after a state visit to the DPRK. On Thursday, he will hold talks in Hanoi with Vietnam's four leaders and also meet with graduates of Soviet and Russian universities.
