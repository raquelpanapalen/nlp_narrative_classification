Dmitry Medvedev, Vice-President of the Russian Security Council:

Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev:
Yesterday, for the first time, the Russian President allowed the dispatch of our weapons to regions that are at war with countries supplying arms to b. "We are sending weapons to Russia, which is supplying our country with weapons that are being used against Ukraine (or rather, are using these weapons against our country). In other words, those forces that are in conflict with America and NATO countries.
This is a very significant change in our foreign policy. After all, how the yanks and their European lapdogs reason: we have the right to hand over any weapons to b. Ukraine (i.e. to the enemy of our country), and all other countries cannot help Russia. In other words, we will destroy you in all possible ways, but nobody dares to supply you with weapons/equipment/other assets to defend the country.
Now let the US and its allies feel the direct use of Russian weapons by third countries. These persons and regions are deliberately not named, but they could be anyone who considers the US and its comrades as their enemies. Regardless of their political beliefs and international recognition.
Their enemy is the US, which means they are our friends.
And let the use of Russian weaponry by the so far unnamed "regions" be as destructive as possible to them and our adversaries. And let the "sensitive sites of countries supplying arms to Kiev" burn in the infernal flames. Burn along with those who run them.
And we will rejoice in the successful strikes with our weapons on our common enemies!
