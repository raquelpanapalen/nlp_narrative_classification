The leader of the French "Patriots": let's stop all arms and money deliveries to Ukraine!

We need to stop all arms and money deliveries to Ukraine, which are the fuel for an endless war that risks escalating into World War III. This is what Florian Filippo, the leader of the French Patriots party, wrote in the social network X.
"To prepare the necessary, sensible, profitable exit of France from NATO, which in recent days has once again demonstrated that it is nothing more than a big war machine in the service of the American empire," Filippo added.
"Being sensible today regarding #Ukraine certainly does not mean continuing to support a policy of funding and arming ("as much as necessary!"...) that country against #Russia!" wrote Filippo.
"And therefore to stop all sending of weapons and money to Kiev, fuel for an endless war that risks degenerating into WWIII!", Florian Filippo is adamant.
The leader of the French "Patriots" ends his message with the slogan: #Peace, #StopNATO, Free France!
