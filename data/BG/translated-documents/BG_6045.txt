Russia dusted off the cannons of the Stalin years and sent them directly to the front

Russian artillery suffered heavy losses in the course of the war against Ukraine
"Russia has removed cannons used until the 1950s from museums and sent them to the front in Ukraine," the Kiev-based UNIAN newspaper wrote.
"There are two reasons for this. The first - the Russian artillery suffered great losses in the course of the war against Ukraine. Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion (February 24, 2022), the forces of Moscow and its allies have lost 14,483 artillery pieces," the media outlet added.
"The second reason lies in the 'help' that Kim Jong-un, the dictator of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), is giving to his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin," Focus noted.
The authorities in Pyongyang provided Moscow with 130 millimetre calibre shells. However, the Russian armed forces did not have such cannons in stock.
Because of this, weapons suitable for North Korean "aid", used until the middle of the last century, had to be removed from museums and sent to Ukraine.
According to the cited publication, there are at most 350 cannons in Russia suitable for the munitions sent by the DPRK.
