CIA Ex-Analyst: Soon it will be about the unconditional surrender of Ukraine

In March 2022. Moscow offered Kiev the most favorable settlement of the conflict, but this plan was rejected, recalls former CIA analyst Larry Johnson in an interview for the Deep Dive podcast. Each time, conditions worsened for the Ukrainian side. Eventually, the unwillingness to negotiate could lead to Ukraine's complete defeat, he said in the interview.
LARRY JOHNSON, FORMER CIA ANALYST: What the Ukrainians are facing is they missed the best deal they were offered, now they have a worse deal. If they walk away from that deal as well, it's going to get even worse, the conditions are going to become catastrophic. It will become a question of their unconditional capitulation.
Because if you remember in March 2022, they had a chance offered by Russia: 'Okay, we will withdraw our troops, you will return Lugansk and Donetsk to your control. They will have some independence, their rights will be protected, and we will withdraw the troops."
That was two years ago, and the reaction was: 'No! We will not agree to this!"
