EXTRAORDINARY: BRICS, Vatican and Switzerland boycotted the Zelensky option. No call for Russia's withdrawal from Ukraine

The BRICS countries, as well as the Vatican and Switzerland, refused to sign the final declaration of the so-called peace conference (in the Zelensky version) in Switzerland.
Key countries such as the Vatican, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, India, Mexico, South Africa, Brazil and the UAE did not sign the document.
Boycotts also came from Slovakia and Armenia.
The document was signed by 80 countries out of 92 present.
The main theses of the declaration are three:
- Ukraine's nuclear power plants should operate under full sovereign control of Ukraine;
- access to the Black and Azov Sea seaports must be restored;
- all prisoners of war must be released and civilians returned to Ukraine;
It is noteworthy that there is no call for withdrawal for Russian troops from Ukraine, and this was the most important thing Zelensky wanted to achieve.
As is well known, Russia did not participate in the peace conference, which nipped it in the bud. The Chinese delegation did not attend either.
