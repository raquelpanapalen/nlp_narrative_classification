Russia tightens nuclear force, begins large-scale...

Vladimir Putin has repeatedly said Russia can use nuclear weapons to defend itself in extreme situations
Russian troops have begun the second stage of a tactical nuclear weapons deployment exercise with Belarusian troops, Reuters reports.
"Russia says the United States and its European allies are pushing the world to the brink of nuclear confrontation by giving Ukraine billions of dollars worth of weapons, some of which are being used against Russian territory.
Since sending thousands of troops to Ukraine on February 24, 2022, President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly said that Russia can use nuclear weapons to defend itself in extreme situations, comments that the West has dismissed as sabre-rattling.
"In the first stage of the drills, Russian troops trained on how to arm and deploy Iskander missiles, while the air force trained on how to arm hypersonic Dagger missiles.
The second stage, announced on Tuesday, involves Russian and Belarusian units "practicing joint training for combat use of non-strategic nuclear weapons," the defence ministry said, as quoted by Reuters.
