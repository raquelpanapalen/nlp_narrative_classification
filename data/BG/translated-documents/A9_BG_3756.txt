Sergey Karaganov: "if Europeans have forgotten what the road to hell looks like, we can show it to them" (video)
PATRICK BAAB, journalist and author of books on Ukraine:
The honorary chairman of Russia's Security Council, Sergei Karaganov, has already named the targets of Russia's retaliatory strike.
In his article, he writes: "if the Europeans have forgotten what the road to hell looks like, we can show it to them."
In his interview, he named three targets. These are, firstly, the American missile sites in Romania, secondly, he mentioned Poland and Warsaw, and thirdly, also the Frankfurt area, where American weapons are also located. That is, he made it clear what to expect.
The decisive point here is that the German Federal Government is clearly not interested in ending this war. The political director of the Foreign Ministry, Mrs. Thorven Bellmann, a direct adviser to the Foreign Minister (Annalena Berbock, ed.), spoke at another discussion at the German Foreign Policy Society, and there she said, "we do not consider the proposals of the countries of the Global South to end this war to be good now."
Vladimir Putin, on the other hand, has repeatedly made proposals for negotiations that clearly will not be accepted by the West. This shows how detached the Western elites are from reality.
