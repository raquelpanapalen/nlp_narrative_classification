Orban harshly to Brussels: we will not give in to this!

He recalled that after the results of the European Parliament elections held on 6-9 June, "the right-wing parties strengthened, while the left and the liberals lost their positions"
In Brussels, they ignored the will of the European people. The new leadership of the European Union, contrary to the will of the majority of Europeans, will stay the course of continuing the conflict in Ukraine and countering Russia.
This is what Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán wrote on Facebook, commenting on the results of the informal EU summit in Brussels, which discussed personnel issues, including nominations for the posts of presidents of the European Council and the European Commission.
"They ignore reality, they ignore the results of the European elections and they ignore the will of the European people. Let us not be naïve: they will continue to support migration and channel more money and weapons into the war between Russia and Ukraine," Orban wrote.
Orbán recalled that after the results of the European Parliament elections held on 6-9 June, "the right-wing parties strengthened, while the left and the liberals lost their positions".
"We will not give in to this! We will join forces with the European right and fight the bureaucrats who advocate migration and war," Orban added.
