The West will "sacrifice" Zelensky when the Russian Federation consolidates its successes on the battlefield - SVR

Leaders of Western countries are preparing to "sacrifice" Vladimir Zelensky when Russian troops consolidate their successes in the zone of a special military operation, Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) said.
"Washington and its satellites are happy with the situation that has developed since May 20, 2024, in which Vladimir Zelensky's legitimacy is completely dependent on Western support. His Western masters will easily sacrifice him when Russia consolidates its successes on the battlefield, and the exhausted and demoralized Ukrainian troops will find themselves in a hopeless situation," the Russian Interior Ministry said.
The department stressed that Zelensky had "definitively lost all independence" and "is on a short leash in the hands of Washington's regional committee handlers and will not be able to escape responsibility for the unfolding of a large-scale war in Europe."
"Having exhausted such "usefulness" of Zelensky and realizing the futility of hopes for "strategic defeat of Russia," the White House will not hesitate to throw him on the dustbin of history and replace him with one of the Ukrainian politicians who would be acceptable to negotiate with Moscow for a peaceful resolution of the conflict. The most suitable candidate in Washington is considered to be former Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valeriy Zaluzhny," the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service said in a press release.
We will remind, earlier American entrepreneur and billionaire Ilon Musk called it a problem that the US authorities have no target in the conflict in Ukraine.
