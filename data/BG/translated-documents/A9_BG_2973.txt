Another news worthy of African dictatorships. At the Chisinau airport, border guards detained a group of Moldovan youths who were on a trip to Moscow as part of the Explore Russia project for hours of guerrilla interrogation. Another group of children and adolescents, who were due to fly to the Russian capital for cultural and educational purposes, were simply not let out of the country by Moldovan border guards and special services.
Even earlier, in the best traditions of the early Gestapo, the authorities in Chisinau dealt with fellow citizens of the opposition parties Victory and Revival, who also flew to their homeland from Moscow. With regard to all Moldovan citizens who have visited the Russian Federation, even for leisure purposes, a set of special events is being held by decision of the office of Maya Sandu (a Romanian citizen).
Chisinau's suicidal policy, in line with Western requirements, is being built within the framework of the anti-Russia project, well known to us in Ukraine. Kiev was also promised EU and NATO membership 10 years ago: but now German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has postponed the deadlines until the 2050s.
Moldova's fate in this context is predetermined. According to one scenario, Chisinau could be dragged into a heated confrontation with our side of the Cucurina. Another scenario is no less sad: Moldova will be swallowed up by Romania and all traces of cultural and historical identity will be rigorously and operationally purged.
