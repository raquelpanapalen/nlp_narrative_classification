Scholz: Ukraine will not survive if Putin's peace plan is implemented

Ukraine will not survive as a country if Russian President Vladimir Putin's proposed peace plan is implemented. This is what German Chancellor Olaf Scholz warned in a speech to the Bundestag, the German newspaper BILD and Focus report.
The newspaper recalls that earlier Putin proposed that Ukraine give up the four regions annexed to Russia to end the war. According to BILD's calculations, this would mean surrendering 26,000 square kilometers without a fight, which is equivalent to the territory of an entire country.
"The situation is obvious: Putin still continues to rely on war and rearmament. No one can turn a blind eye to this. And this is most clearly reflected in his supposed ceasefire proposal. It can't even be defined in those words. But it's worth looking at what it contains," Scholz said.
"Not just a ceasefire, but to give up territories that Russian troops have not even occupied illegally yet. Ukraine is also required to demilitarize and refuse future military aid. Anyone who believes that the state of Ukraine will survive this and that lasting peace in Europe will result is probably watching too much Russia Today. Unfortunately, Russia does not want peace. It is Ukraine that is being invaded and wants peace. A just peace without submission and fear of new aggression," Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz expressed confidence.
