Angel Dzhambazki: The Entombment of the Bulgarian Energy Sector Must Stop

Bulgaria starts to "harvest" the fruits of the "Green Deal". This is happening after today's announcement of the shutdown of the second largest thermal power plant in the country - TPP Maritsa East 3. One of the largest electricity producers in Bulgaria (nearly 1 GW of capacity) has been forced to shut down due to rising climate targets and continued pressure to close TPPs.
It is because of these insane carbon allowances, the constant pressure from all sorts of regulations under the Green Deal and the resulting legislation known as Fit for 55, that the baseload facilities in Bulgaria's energy mix are being forced to either operate at a loss or close their doors. The Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) is a market-determined tax. In this case, the scheme applies only to electricity and heat generators, energy-intensive industrial sectors and aviation, and in 2028 many other sectors will join this type of mechanism.
"In practice, this means stifling the thermal power plants that pay this peculiar tax and ensuring the dominance of renewable energy companies that are allowed to trade 'guarantees of origin' - in addition to the sale price of energy. This policy must stop. It is hitting the Bulgarian entrepreneur, Bulgarian citizens and killing one of the main sectors of the Bulgarian economy, which is the energy sector."
At the same time - in recent months Bulgaria has turned from an exporter into an importer of electricity.
"Bulgaria must have an adequate long-term policy to ensure cheap, reliable and sustainable base capacities. The current policy, following the folly of the green alarmists, is leading the Bulgarian energy sector towards total chaos. In the long term, this is the real threat to our energy security," added Dzhambazki.
