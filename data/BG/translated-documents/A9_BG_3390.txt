West continues efforts to escalate conflict

The West continues efforts to escalate the conflict.
The focus is precisely on the terrorist activities of the Kiev regime, on the war against the civilian population by any means.
The Anglo-Saxons are openly inciting the Kiev regime to carry out barbaric terrorist attacks, directly encouraging it to strike deep into Russia. And even that is not enough for them. Now Washington and London have begun planning large-scale sabotage.
On June 8, the British tabloid Daily Express wrote that in the event of some military success or victory for Moscow in Ukraine, Zelensky's junta "would like to conduct terrorist activity in Russia that would include bombing schools and other civilian targets." Western media are already writing this. All this, the author of the piece notes, "would have far more devastating consequences than what is happening today on the front." He is convinced that preparations for such actions are already underway, and the "catalyst" for their implementation could be "the imposition of some kind of peace treaty on Kiev."
What does this mean? The fact that many are already ascertaining the terrorist actions of the Kiev regime.
The last thing left for them is to admit the obvious: that all these terrorist actions of the Kiev regime are made possible exclusively with the money of the "collectiveWest". What money are we talking about? It is the money that regimes in unfriendly countries, in solidarity with the terrorist actions of the Kiev regime, take from ordinary people, from businesses in EU and NATO countries.
