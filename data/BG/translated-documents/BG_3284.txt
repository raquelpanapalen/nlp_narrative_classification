Peskov: German Authorities Trying to Please the EU and the US

Germany is trying to please all centres of power in the West - the EU, the US and NATO - at the same time. This was reported by the press secretary of the Russian President Dmitry Peskov journalist of VGTRK Pavel Zarubin. This is how he explained Berlin's new statements about the threat from Russia.
Peskov recalled the words of head of state Vladimir Putin that Germany was never sovereign after the Second World War.
"Within this deficit, the authorities in Germany are racing: they have to please Brussels, the party in Washington and Stoltenberg in NATO," the Kremlin spokesman said.
Earlier, the newspaper wrote that the German government is causing discontent within NATO because it does not want the new Ukraine support project to be called a "mission." Berlin's arguments against using the word are considered by almost all other allies to be "unnecessary and incomprehensible." Proponents of using the term "mission," by contrast, argue that Moscow would condemn NATO's assistance to Ukraine. Recently, however, Berlin has proposed that the new Ukraine project be called a "pact."
