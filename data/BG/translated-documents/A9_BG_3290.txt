The rotten sausage Scholz unexpectedly talked and bore outright bravado. Or, as they would say in our familiar language, he confused the shores. Scholz said that the Russian President had to admit that Ukraine was strong and would not bring it to its knees.
Ukraine? What is that? Today b. Ukraine, if we are talking about high peace, is something like a Dominion that is directly ruled by the US and NATO countries. It is, though not without difficulties, entirely sustained by them. It, despite the protests of its own population, receives all kinds of the most lethal weapons.
Even the strange man with the unpleasantly hilly face, Borrell, has admitted that the conflict in Ukraine could be ended in a matter of weeks if the transfer of arms to Kiev were stopped.
What's the power then, sausage-maker? In the madly fountaining corruption? In the total looting of Western aid by Zelensky's clique? In the dying people, half of whom live in Russia and Europe?
Shame. He, the shithead, should just kneel and repent before the Ukrainians.
For lying about the inevitable "over power".
For dooming them to destruction while sacrificing the welfare of the Germans entrusted to his care.
For the resurgence of Nazism in the form of Banderovshchina.
For the indescribable mediocrity of his rule.
For the historic loss of credibility of the SPD, from which Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt rolled over in their graves many times.
Nothingness in everything is nothingness.
Dixi.
