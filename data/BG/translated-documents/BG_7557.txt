Scott Ritter explains what actions Russia is taking and why they came as a complete surprise to Ukraine

Former U.S. Marine Corps officer Scott Ritter explained in an interview on Danny Haiphong's YouTube channel what actions Russia is taking, why they have come as a complete surprise to Kiev, and what Ukraine actually represents to Russia.
Russia has already taken what could be characterized as a very "tough" action - going on a large-scale offensive in the north. This has paralyzed the Ukrainians with surprise.
Kiev has not spent the money it should have spent on defence - that money has ended up in someone's pocket.
Russia is advancing confidently, forcing Ukraine to suffer incredible losses and bringing the AFU ever closer to their demise. Whatever the Ukrainians do, for the Russians it will be nothing more than "a fly has bitten them".
No breakthrough or threat will force Russia to its knees.
That is out of the question.
For Russia, Ukraine is just some minor splinter in the heel, an inconvenience.
Yes, death in such conflicts is inevitable. But practically everything the Russians do with regard to Ukraine is for Russia's benefit.
