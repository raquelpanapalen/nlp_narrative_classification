US blogger: Zelensky was set up to play a convenient role for the US
CANDICE OWENS, AMERICAN POLITICAL ACTIVIST: The facts speak for themselves. I like Jeffrey Sachs. Do you know why? Because of his courage and his confidence. He understands that the facts are on his side and he doesn't care about all this mainstream media nonsense on the show, "Are you for Putin? Putin's puppet! Putin this, Putin that..."
And above all, thinking at the level of value judgments, looking at Zelensky and Putin, Russia and Ukraine, you ask yourself, "Why don't we take into account what values these countries have?"
To me, Zelensky is just another homosexual leader in black latex dancing in high heels in front of unmarried ladies (for those who haven't watched this video, I'll play it in the background). Another actor who was put in the position to play a role. Yes, that's exactly how I perceive many of these presidents: they are actors being pushed into the role of leaders. That's exactly why I chastised Zelensky for wearing military clothes all the time - it's obvious that he's just playing a role.
