Putin complained: Russia can only rely on itself

Vladimir Putin complained that no one will help Russia as it wages war against Ukraine.
The Russian president said his country could rely "only on itself" as he addressed military personnel gathered in the Georgiev Hall of the Grand Kremlin Palace.
In remarks captured and posted on Telegram by state television, he spoke of the need for a stable economy in Russia to support its defense ministry.
"Everyone matters: the salary, the new equipment, the orders - it's very important. This is a base," Putin said.
"In this sense, we can only rely on ourselves. No one is going to come and give us something with an outstretched hand, everyone will do it themselves. We can do it," he added.
Putin's comments come after he signed a treaty with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un promising mutual military assistance in the event of an attack on Russia or North Korea.
The agreement states that "the other side shall provide military and other assistance without delay by all means at its disposal."
The International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants on Tuesday, July 25, for former Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and General Valery Gerasimov on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity for attacks against civilians.
Russia's Security Council says the ICC arrest warrant for Sergei Shoigu is part of the West's hybrid war against Moscow, according to the state news agency.
Shoigu, 69, was seen as a key figure in Putin's decision to invade Ukraine before he was replaced as defence minister in May this year.
The invasion, in which Russia expected to quickly take over Kiev and instead install a puppet leader, faced serious resistance from a wave of brave Ukrainians.
Gerasimov, 68, who has been chief of the general staff since 2012, continues to lead military operations in Ukraine.
