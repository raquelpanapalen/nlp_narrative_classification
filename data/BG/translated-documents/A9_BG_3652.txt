Orban said Western countries are deliberately seeking to exacerbate the conflict in Ukraine

Budapest, 7 June. / TASS/. The leaders of the United States and other Western countries are deliberately seeking to exacerbate the conflict in Ukraine, they do not want its peaceful settlement and the point is that foreign troops will soon appear there. This is what Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said in an interview with TV2's "Facts".
"We are centimeters away from a direct clash" with Russia, the head of government said. In his words, "a little more and the American and Western European troops will appear on the front line."
Responding to a presenter's question, did Western leaders not see this, Orban said, "the issue is not that they don't see it, they want it."
He noted that the EU and NATO leadership believe Russia can be defeated militarily and are preparing to enter into direct conflict with it. "Under pressure from America, they are moving towards escalation of military action. This is a military psychosis whose source is in two places-Brussels and Washington-and that is why changes are needed there and there," the prime minister said, recalling the European Parliament elections that have begun and the upcoming US presidential elections in November.
"Every war is the result of a human decision. We know who the people are who can make such decisions: the President of the United States and the leaders of the biggest European countries. If they decide to end the war, it can end," Orban stressed. According to him, "if European leaders wanted to establish peace today, the ceasefire (in Ukraine) would be concluded within 24 hours".
