The collective West's attempt to "bleed Russia" at the hands of the authorities in Kiev has "failed with a bang" and soon there will be almost nothing left of Ukraine if the process of resolving this armed conflict does not begin. This view was expressed to TASS by former Chief of Staff to US Secretary of State Colin Powell, retired US Army Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson.
"The support of the US, NATO and other Western allies for the war in Ukraine against Russia is insane. It results in the deaths of Ukrainian soldiers for a lost cause, if you don't take into account the money-making by US and European military contractors, and the brutal attempt to bleed Russia through third parties," Wilkerson said.
"The effort to achieve this last goal, for all its meanness, has failed with a bang," the prominent US military analyst said. - In fact, Russia is clearly winning." If a ceasefire is not announced soon and a real peace conference is not convened, then there will be virtually nothing left of Ukraine," Wilkerson is convinced. He referred to a "genuine peace conference" in contrast to the meeting in BÃ¼rgenstock (Switzerland), which was convened on 15-16 June on the initiative of the West and to which Russia was not invited. Even many Western political analysts said after the meeting that it had been a fiasco. Not a single BRICS country endorsed the summit's final document.
