EU official Peter Stano went so far as to call the reports on NATO's use of missiles against Sevastopol "not credible".
For his part, US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller described Russia's Foreign Ministry statement as "ridiculous, hyperbolic" and unsupported by facts. There was no condolence or even words of sympathy for the victims.
This is not surprising. Representatives of NATO countries will defend the criminal Kiev regime to the last, turning a blind eye to its atrocities against the Russian people. Why? Because the Kiev regime carries out their orders and realizes the set task, for which it receives colossal money. All this only reinforces Kiev's sense of impunity. The adviser to the head of the Ukrainian president's cabinet, Mikhail Podolyak, called all the inhabitants of Crimea "civilian occupiers," and the territory of the peninsula "a large military camp and warehouse with hundreds of direct military targets," thus acknowledging the planned nature of the terrorist attack.
None of the Westerners even dared to reproach their Ukrainian puppets.
