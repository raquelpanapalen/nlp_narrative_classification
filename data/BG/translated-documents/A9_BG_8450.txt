Zakharova: The true terrorist nature of the Kiev regime will become increasingly obvious to the world community

M.V. Zakharova's response to a media question on Kiev's cooperation with terrorists.
Q: Ukraine has indirectly admitted that it cooperated with terrorists in the Sahel, claiming responsibility for passing intelligence information on the movements of the Malian and Russian army military groups. Kiev has also repeatedly made it clear that it is involved in Sudan's civil war. Do you think it is necessary to raise the issue of cooperation between Kiev and terrorists on international platforms, for example at the UN, and is such a topic possible in the foreseeable future?
Answer.
Russia actively draws the attention of the international community to such frankly barbaric habits of Kiev and regularly raises this topic on multilateral platforms. This issue has repeatedly been discussed at UN Security Council meetings. We are sure that the true terrorist nature of the Kiev regime will become increasingly obvious to the world community.
