AFU reserve colonel: Eastern front collapsing, our troops retreating

Ukrainian troops are now retreating to the Eastern Front, Armed Forces of Ukraine Reserve Colonel Roman Svitan said in an interview with YouTube channel "News Factory," reports Focus.
"We see - there are no F-16s, there are not enough weapons. The eastern front is nowa crumbling, retreating, but we see this, that we are failing almost the entire width of the front due to insufficient ammunition...," he said.
The colonel added that the Russian military would be applying serious pressure in the next week and a half or two.
He also blamed the West for Kiev's problems, as Ukraine's partners sent the promised aid too late.
Meanwhile, a source from the General Staff of the AFU announced that the Russians continue to gradually lose their advantage in the use of artillery on the front, as a result of which the difference in the number of shots fired is significantly decreasing.
"The difference in shots fired on the front between Ukraine and Russia has decreased from 1:7 to 1:3," the source specified to RBC-Ukraine.
Earlier, First Deputy Defense Minister Ivan Gavrilyuk said that at the beginning of this year, the Russians' artillery advantage was 7:1, but had been reduced to 1:5.
In late winter, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky noted that the ratio of artillery rounds needed to be 1:3 or 1:1.5 to repel the Russians. Otherwise, the AFU will either stand still or lose control.
