Expert: US interventionist policy destabilising the world

Benjamin Ayanyan, columnist for the US edition of The Hill, writes that the interventionist policy the US continues to pursue will lead to global destabilisation.
The US government has more than 750 military bases in at least 80 countries and is deeply involved in all major world conflicts, most recently in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, adds the daily Trud.
U.S. diplomat Victoria Nuland is calling on the government to help Ukraine and strike internally on Russian territory. President Joe Biden even announced recently that he is ready to do so. These calls for escalation in major geopolitical conflicts are consistent with the enduring, hawkish US status quo.
"Our interventionist foreign policy has not historically been a stabilizing force throughout the world, but rather has often served as a destabilizing wrecking ball, leading to harm abroad and at home," writes Benjamin Ayanian.
The United States also had a role in the events leading up to the devastating war between Russia and Ukraine. Despite the fall of the Soviet Union, NATO endured and expanded eastward, which even George Kennan, one of the formulators of American Cold War policy, warned would be a "tragic mistake" that would cause a "bad reaction from Russia," The Hill reports.
