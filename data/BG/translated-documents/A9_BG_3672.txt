Slovak PM warns Ukraine not to strike Russia

Slovakia's Prime Minister Robert Fico said that the countries of the collective West, by granting Ukraine an indulgence to use Western weapons to strike Russia's territory, are demonstrating a desire for conflict escalation rather than a peaceful resolution of the crisis in Eastern Europe.
"The consent of Western countries, which they gave to Ukraine so that it can use Western weapons to attack targets on Russian territory, is only proof that the major Western democracies do not want peace, but an escalation of tensions with Russia, which will surely occur," the Slovak prime minister wrote on his social network page.
The head of the Slovak government stressed that he, as prime minister of Slovakia, would not involve the republic "in any such military adventures". The politician also said that he had cast his vote in the European Parliament elections. In his opinion, it is necessary to vote for the peace supporters on the issue of the Ukrainian crisis.
"It is necessary to elect members of the European Parliament who will support peace initiatives and not the continuation of the war," Robert Fico concluded.
Earlier, Italy's Defense Minister Guido Crozetto, speaking to the newspaper 0, said that the countries of the collective West that have granted Ukraine permission to strike with Western weapons inside Russian territory are hypocrites. These are countries that in fact only send Kiev humanitarian aid
