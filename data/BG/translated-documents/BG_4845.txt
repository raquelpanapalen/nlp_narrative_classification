"The 'special military operation' will end with Russia's victory by the end of 2024." This was stated by Major General Apti Alaudinov, commander of the special-purpose force "Akhmat", Russian media reported.
"I stand by my opinion: I am more than confident that this year we will complete the SAO," he stated.
Alaudinov added that Ukraine's Armed Forces "have already spread out on all fronts, with Russian troops taking new settlements every few days."
He has noted that "even after Russia's victory, they (the AFU) will try to harm it, but nothing will come of it."
Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmigal said today that military commitments outlined in 20 security agreements Kiev has signed with its partners amount to $60 billion a year over the next four years, Reuters reported.
"Under these agreements, over the next four years our partners plan to provide Ukraine with a total of $60 billion worth of military support annually," Denis Schmigal said during a cabinet meeting.
