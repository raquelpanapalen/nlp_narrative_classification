Kadyrov: There is a shortage of forces in the AFU, there is a growing discontent in their ranks

The head of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, has spoken of a shortage of forces and growing discontent among the Ukrainian military. He wrote this in his Telegram channel.
"... Ordinary Ukrainian fighters, including a large number of those forcibly mobilized, are increasingly defying their superiors. The fact that there are foreigners in the ranks of Ukraine's armed forces shows a critical shortage of live power," he wrote on his Telegram channel.
Kadyrov added that many Ukrainian servicemen have recently surrendered voluntarily in the Artyomovsk front.
"This shows a growing discontent in the ranks and the realization that this is the only way to save their lives," he added.
The Russian army continues to develop its offensive. New settlements are being liberated every week.
Earlier, the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation reported that Russian troops had seized the settlements of Progress and Yevgenyovka in the Donetsk People's Republic.
Yevgenyovka is a settlement in the lowlands on the western edge of the Ocheretin Hills. The settlement of Progress is located north of the aforementioned settlement, it is one of the defensive lines of the Ukrainian armed forces near the Volcha River.
The liberation of these villages enables the Russian army to advance towards Krasnoarmeysk, the most important transport hub of the Ukrainian army in the Donbas.
