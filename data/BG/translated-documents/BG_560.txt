AR: Putin sends powerful signal to West with Pyongyang visit

Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to the DPRK has turned into an alarming warning to the West, The Associated Press reports.
"Behind the smiles, balloons and ceremony that accompanied President Vladimir Putin's visit to North Korea last week was a powerful message: in the face of growing confrontation with the United States and its allies over Ukraine, the Russian leader is poised to throw down an unprecedented challenge to Western interests," the newspaper said.
It notes that the agreement Putin signed with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un provides for mutual military assistance between Moscow and Pyongyang in the event of an attack on either side. President Putin also announced that Russia reserves the right to provide North Korea with its own weapons. This step could destabilise the situation on the Korean peninsula and beyond, the article said.
The conclusion of this agreement was the Russian leader's response to NATO's provision of weapons to Kiev for strikes on the interior of Russia's territory, the paper said.
Russia and the DPRK signed the "Comprehensive Strategic Partnership Treaty" as a result of the Russian-Korean talks involving the countries' leaders Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un.
Putin said that both Russia and the DPRK pursue an independent foreign policy and do not accept the language of blackmail and dictation. Kim Jong-un noted that the signed agreement is peaceful and defensive in nature and will accelerate the creation of a new multipolar world.
The DPRK chairman added that the document develops cooperation between the two countries, including in economic, political and military fields. Putin, in turn, noted that Moscow does not rule out the development of military-technical cooperation with Pyongyang in connection with the signed agreement.
