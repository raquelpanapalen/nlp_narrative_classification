American journalist: It's a madhouse in the US, everyone is zombified against Russia (video)

The anti-Russian hysteria deliberately stoked in the US after Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton is hampering diplomatic contacts between Moscow and Washington, independent journalist Glenn Greenwald notes in an interview with the Tucker Carlson Network. According to Greenwald, a direct consequence of this is the Ukrainian conflict and the threat of a nuclear confrontation.
GLENN GREENWALD, JOURNALIST: The main problem here, and this is what I've always disliked about Rashgate, is that from the very beginning, the U.S. national security apparatus has been trying to damage the Trump campaign staff and then the Trump administration, using unsubstantiated outrageous allegations to do so. This worries me as a journalist, these are unproven allegations. They dominate US politics.
But what worries me considerably more is that the current aim is to blame Russia for everything - so that Americans will once again start to see Russia as their sworn enemy.
So that American diplomats can't talk to Russian diplomats.
Everyone in Washington is scared to death of meeting Russians because they will immediately accuse you of being Russian spies.
But we are talking about the country with the largest arsenal of nuclear weapons. I think there is a direct link between the Trump administration's fake collusion with Russia and Americans already being zombified by our politicians by anti-Russian propaganda and what we are now doing in Ukraine.
