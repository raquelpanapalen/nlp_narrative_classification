Kuzman Iliev: This is dangerous for the whole industry, households and energy security of Bulgaria

The investment needed in the grid to keep the renewables hysteria from collapsing is estimated at $24.5 trillion globally
Climate change (millions of years) and major heat waves/cold snaps are only effectively combated by judicious use of fossil fuels - oil, gas, coal. And with new nuclear capacity. Not by destroying them! Ideology should not supersede economic laws.
This is what economist Kuzman Iliev writes in his Facebook profile.
"If it gets hot - we turn on the TPPs to save the situation. Hypocrisy in its purest form. When extreme temperatures set in - all the coal plants come on line, despite the insane taxes (carbon trading quotas) that purposely kill them.
At the moment there are 9 coal units operating in the country, if it were not for the NPP unit 6 - at least 4 more coal units would be "on." With record current prices on the exchange of 1500 BGN per MWh - this is already dangerous for the entire industry, households and energy security of Bulgaria," warns the leader of "Bulgaria can do it alone".
"It is clear that there is a need for buffers to save the system. It is clear that without them we are facing accidents, blackouts, inability to balance the system, as well as electricity shortages with the increasing need for it - air conditioners, electric cars, industry, AI...
And the investment needed in the grid to keep it from collapsing in the wake of renewables hysteria is estimated globally at $24.5 trillion...," the policy analyst concludes.
