Worrying: Climate change and changing bird migration patterns Birds migrate to find optimal breeding sites and feeding areas. Traditionally, these journeys are made in such a way that birds arrive at breeding sites when food sources—such as insects and plants—are abundant. Climate change is not just a buzzword. It is a phenomenon that is causing significant changes in our natural world. One of the most noticeable impacts is the change in bird migration patterns. For centuries, many bird species have followed predictable routes and timing, but these patterns are changing rapidly as global temperatures rise. Birds migrate to find optimal breeding sites and feeding areas. Traditionally, these journeys are made in such a way that birds arrive at breeding sites when food sources—such as insects and plants—are abundant. However, rising temperatures are now causing these resources to be available earlier in the year. Changing bird migration Warmth causes plants to bloom and insects to emerge earlier, forcing birds to alter their migration schedules. As a result, many species are now arriving earlier at their breeding sites. However, not all species are able to adjust so quickly to these changing conditions. For example, the Himalayan monal, a beautiful pheasant found in the hilly regions of the Himalayas, is experiencing shifts in the timing of plant growth and insect emergence. This mismatch results in the monal seeking food sources that are either depleted or not abundant, affecting their ability to breed and raise their young successfully.
