US urges India to &#39;use&#39; relationship with Russia, asks Putin to end &#39;illegal&#39;... Noting that India has a long-standing relationship with Russia, the US has said it has encouraged New Delhi to &quot;use&quot; that relationship with Moscow and urge President Vladimir Putin to end his &quot;illegal war&quot; against Ukraine. These remarks were made by State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller at his daily press conference on Monday. “India has a long-standing relationship with Russia. I think that&#39;s well known. And we have encouraged India to use that relationship, that long-standing relationship with Russia and their unique position, to urge President Putin to end his illegal war and find a just peace, lasting peace to this conflict; to ask Putin to respect the UN Charter, to respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine,” he said. &quot;We will continue to impress upon the Indian government, which is an important partner of ours in terms of relations with Russia,&quot; Mr Miller said in response to a question. Mr Miller made similar remarks soon after Prime Minister Narendra Modi left Russia on July 9. Mr Modi was in Russia for two days from July 8-9 for the 22nd India-Russia Annual Summit, which was closely watched by the West amid the raging Ukraine conflict. This was the Prime Minister&#39;s first visit to Russia since the war between Moscow and Kiev began in 2022. During his talks with Mr Putin on July 9, Prime Minister Modi told President Putin that a solution to the Ukraine conflict is not possible on the battlefield and peace efforts do not succeed amid bombs and bullets. India is strongly defending its &quot;special and privileged strategic partnership&quot; with Russia and has maintained momentum in relations despite the Ukraine conflict. India has not yet condemned Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and has consistently advocated a resolution of the conflict through dialogue and diplomacy.
