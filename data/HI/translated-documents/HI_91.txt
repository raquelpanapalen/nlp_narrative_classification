Ukraine&#39;s attack in Kursk has put Russia in a dilemma whether to save Donbass or Kursk Oblast. Now Russia cannot launch any major military attack for the whole year. It will have to put all its strength in protecting its areas. Before the attack on Kursk, Russia was losing about 1000 soldiers every day. But every month it was recruiting 20 to 30 thousand people. Almost the same number of military vehicles are being prepared. But now, after the arrival of the Ukrainian army in Kursk, Russia is left with only a few reserve military units. Which are being used to take on the Ukrainian army in Kursk and Belgorod. Therefore, Russia is not in a position to fight a ground battle except air and artillery attacks.
