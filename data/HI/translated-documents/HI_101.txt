India can help end the war between Ukraine and Russia: Report For a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia, India is especially looking at Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a key mediator. According to a Politico report, Kiev hopes that India&#39;s neutral stance and diplomatic influence can be an important step towards ending the war. Recently, PM Modi met Ukrainian President Zelensky. Ukrainian media Interfax quoted Zelensky&#39;s top adviser Andriy Yermak as saying, &#39;During his visit to Ukraine, PM Modi made it clear that India would never support any plan or proposal that involves any compromise with Ukraine&#39;s territorial integrity.&#39; A high-ranking Ukrainian official, on condition of anonymity, said that India is a big hope of Kiev. A peace agreement can be reached because of India. According to the official, Modi had made it clear in talks with Kiev that Ukraine would inevitably need to compromise on some things to end Russia&#39;s attack. In the eyes of Kiev, Modi has come a long way in a short time. When he visited Moscow in July and warmly embraced Russian President Putin, Kiev&#39;s reaction was sharp. Zelensky called the hug a huge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts. Because dozens of Ukrainians were killed in a Russian missile attack on the same day. Six weeks after the Moscow visit, as Ukraine&#39;s resentment grew, Modi traveled to Kiev to meet Zelensky. He talked about remaining &#39;friends&#39; with Kiev and helping in a peace agreement.
