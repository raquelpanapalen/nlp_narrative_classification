From &#39;papa ne war rukwa di&#39; to global peacemaker, know how PM Modi is maintaining balance between Russia and Ukraine?

He is playing the cards right. Prime Minister Narendra Modi&#39;s diplomatic moves amid the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine have established India as an important player on the global stage. Modi&#39;s recent visit to Ukraine, the first by an Indian Prime Minister in three decades, has not only reignited discussions in India but also demonstrated his ability to maintain a delicate balance between conflicting global powers. This balancing act, coupled with India&#39;s historic ties with both Russia and Ukraine, has raised expectations about PM Modi&#39;s potential as a peacemaker in these turbulent times. He is playing the cards right. Be it the G20 summit hosted by India, or his almost back-to-back visits to both Russia and Ukraine in a span of six weeks. Diplomatic Strategy India&#39;s relations with Russia date back to the Cold War era when the Soviet Union was a firm ally. The Indo-Soviet Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Cooperation signed in 1971 is a testimony to the deep ties between the two countries. Russia has been an important defence partner, supplying military equipment and technology to India for decades. On the other hand, Ukraine has also been an important partner for India after gaining independence from the Soviet Union, especially in sectors such as defence, education and agriculture. Managing these relationships has been a difficult challenge during the Russia-Ukraine conflict. While the West, led by the US, has pressured countries to take a stance against Russia, India has maintained a neutral stance, advocating dialogue and peace. The Modi government has continued to hold dialogue with both Russia and Ukraine and has refused to bow to international pressure to isolate Russia. An example of this is India&#39;s ongoing business deals with Russia, including purchase of crude oil, despite Western sanctions. Modi&#39;s Ukraine visit was symbolic, indicating India&#39;s commitment to peace and a willingness to engage with all parties involved. The reception he received in both Russia and Ukraine highlights India&#39;s unique position as a nation that can bridge the gap between East and West. The fact that Modi managed to get such a warm welcome in both countries highlights his respect on the international stage. &#39;Papa ne vaar rukwa di&#39; goes viral on social media In India, Modi&#39;s Ukraine visit has sparked a wave of comments on social media. The phrase &#39;papa ne war rukwa di&#39;, which originated during the Lok Sabha elections, has resurfaced, this time with a different tone. Modi&#39;s supporters have taken to platforms such as X to praise his diplomatic efforts, with comments such as &quot;Modi ji is truly a global leader&quot; and &quot;India&#39;s position as a peacemaker has now been strengthened&quot;. Critics, however, are sceptical. Some have questioned whether Modi&#39;s visit will have any concrete impact on the ground, asking &quot;Is this visit just a PR exercise?&quot; and &quot;What concrete steps is India taking to establish peace?&quot; But one thing is clear. PM Modi has done what no other head of state has been able to do: meeting both Putin and Zelensky in a span of just a few weeks. This reinforces India&#39;s role and position as a global peacemaker. Modi&#39;s efforts to engage with both Russia and Ukraine and his emphasis on dialogue and peace could establish India as a potential mediator in the conflict. India&#39;s historical non-alignment policy, coupled with its current stance of neutrality, gives it the credibility it needs to act as a mediator. In addition, India&#39;s growing influence on the global stage and Modi&#39;s personal rapport with the leaders of both Russia and Ukraine allow India to play a constructive role in bringing the two sides to the negotiating table. India&#39;s Strategic Independence What is particularly impressive in Modi&#39;s approach is his ability to maintain strategic independence. Despite India&#39;s close ties with Russia and its economic engagements, Modi has managed to stay in the good books of the United States. This balancing act is no small feat, given the current geopolitical environment, where aligning too closely with one power often leads to alienation from others. Modi&#39;s diplomacy has allowed India to assert its sovereignty and pursue its national interests without getting drawn into the binary struggle of East versus West. Opposition falls silent Interestingly, while Modi&#39;s visit has attracted widespread attention, the opposition, especially the Congress, has remained largely silent. This silence is notable, especially given the aggressive stance adopted by the opposition during the Lok Sabha elections with jibes such as &quot;papa ne vaar rukwa di&quot;. The lack of response from the Congress may be a sign of recognition of the diplomatic tightrope Modi is walking, which is difficult to criticise without appearing unpatriotic or unsupportive of India&#39;s global standing.
