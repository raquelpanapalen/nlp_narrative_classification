Financial Times accuses India of helping in Ukraine war In the report, the British newspaper claimed that in October 2022, Alexander Gaponov (deputy head of the Radio Electronics Division of the Russian Ministry of Industry and Trade) planned to buy electronics from India for use in drones and missiles. It claimed that Gaponov used an organization to buy &#39;dual-use goods&#39; from India using digital currency and Indian rupees and avoid scrutiny from Western countries. Citing leaked documents, the &#39;Financial Times&#39; alleged that Rs 100 billion was spent on the purchase of parts for servers, telecom and other electronic equipment. It was also alleged that Russia also spent money to strengthen electronics factories in India to ensure a continuous supply of its critical resources. These claims of the Financial Times are hard to believe because all these goods were available to Russia from China and it could have bought them without investment. If Russia had to buy these goods, it would have bought them from China because, firstly, China could provide it cheaper goods and secondly, there would have been no supply problem between the two countries.
