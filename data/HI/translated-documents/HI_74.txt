India&#39;s stand on the Russia-Ukraine war, many needs and challenges ahead Hyderabad: The Russia-Ukraine war in Europe, despite the apparent peace in Far Asia, is at a critical juncture. Russia is moving towards Kharkiv, Ukraine&#39;s most prominent city, although it will gain little. Strategic developments on the battlefield are slow, yet it could re-establish Russia in the east of Ukraine with new border demarcations. On the other hand, US aid of more than $60 billion approved by the US Congress in April could boost Western arms supplies to Ukraine. However, with no final outcome in sight, global stakeholders are wary of basing their interests firmly on the emerging parameters of the war in Europe. As the Russia-Ukraine war has evolved, global expectations from India have varied. This includes seeing India as a potential mediator to seeing it as a party with a stake in both Ukraine and Russia. As the war has prolonged, these expectations have begun to re-emerge. Most prominently, India&#39;s participation and its role in the upcoming Ukraine Peace Summit to be held in Switzerland on June 15-16. India seems to be moving ahead untroubled in the backdrop of the Russo-Ukraine war, but what challenges lie ahead for India and where does a geographically far-off European war fit into India&#39;s strategic calculations? India and Russia have a long-standing relationship of over 70 years. From defence imports to strategic partnerships, the ties between these two countries are very deep. India&#39;s dependence on Russia for defence equipment and maintenance is significant, but are these factors enough to strengthen its position on issues with global implications? It would be simplistic to limit the nuances of this relationship to just defence or history. First, the bilateral relationship has evolved considerably since the Cold War era. Secondly, India&#39;s strategic and economic position has changed significantly, leading to a shift in its bilateral and multilateral influence. Strategic Autonomy Before the Russo-Ukraine war began, India had dynamic trade relations with both Ukraine and Russia. The ongoing war has disrupted supplies from both countries, affecting India&#39;s energy and food security. Like most countries, India has had to adapt and rebalance. India&#39;s stance is against any kind of war in this era. However, its position has been described as supporting its own interests rather than favoring one side over the other. India&#39;s objective assessment of its interests in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war can be based on three premises... its strategic autonomy, the superpower restructuring of the global order, and its energy and defense requirements. Amidst the Russia-Ukraine conflict, India has maintained a neutral stance, refraining from taking sides. This approach is based on several key factors. First, India&#39;s historical perspective emphasizes the absence of direct stakes in European continental disputes. Just as India would not appreciate external intervention in Asian conflicts, it refrains from intervening in European affairs. The primary context of the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine is European continental history, where India&#39;s stakes are absent. India’s decision to maintain strategic autonomy in the Russia-Ukraine war is prudent for several reasons. First, siding with either side risks entrapping India in a conflict with far-reaching consequences. Given the complex web of alliances and interests, neutrality protects India’s national interests and diplomatic flexibility. Restructuring the global order The nature of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, in effect a great power conflict, raises concerns about dividing the world into opposing blocs. With Russia on one side and Ukraine backed by the West on the other, the outcome appears to be long-lasting and dire. This leads to a fragmentation of the world order. India’s interests lie in navigating the changing geopolitical currents. The evolving global order underlines the need for multi-alignment rather than aligning with any one power bloc. By staying away from partisan positions, India must navigate the geopolitical landscape while safeguarding its economic and strategic interests. Geopolitically, the Russia-Ukraine war is a great power conflict that threatens to structurally fragment the world into heavily polarized parts and various multi-aligned groups. Given the alignment of Russia and Ukraine, on opposite sides backed by the West and with little sign of compromise, the outcome of the Russia-Ukraine war seems inevitable. It will accelerate the rift in the world order. Signs of this fragmentation are already visible. Russia, China, Iran, Syria, North Korea and some other countries are on one side, and the West on the other. Of course, there is ample room for countries to remain neutral in this conflict. Taking a stance without significant stakes always complicates the values versus interests equation in international relations. The world order is in fact in a phase of transition from multipolarity to multi-alignment. The Russia-Ukraine war, as well as the Hamas-Israel conflict, seek to disrupt this natural transition. These disruptions have pushed back multi-alignment. It has also strengthened multipolarity, where power concentration is likely to be asymmetrically higher than power dispersion. However, the resulting multipolarity will be full of multi-aligned interests. In other words, countries can be politically aligned with one side, while maintaining economic ties with the other. China, with its strong ties with Russia and relatively stable economic ties with the West, perhaps best represents this duality. India’s Energy and Defence Needs Russia is one of India’s largest defence suppliers, so this relationship is of great strategic importance. From February 2022, India’s oil dependence on Russia adds another layer of complexity, not only because of supply chain issues but also because of price variables. Despite being an energy-dependent nation, India’s oil imports from Russia underline its dependence on the global energy market. Stability of oil prices is an important factor for a large energy-dependent country like India. There are competing predictions about a Russia-Ukraine war, which should not muddle India’s options. India&#39;s position should not be influenced by external factors such as the possible outcome of the war. Finally, what would India&#39;s protection of its interests in the face of a Russia-Ukraine war mean for India&#39;s other great power relations? For its relationship with the US, it could mean circumventing more restrictions and additional end-use monitoring obligations to ensure India&#39;s own interoperability with the US. Secondly, the China factor in India-Russia relations is likely to evolve regardless of China-Russia relations, unless dramatic changes cause China&#39;s relations with the West to deteriorate.
