Various videos of US President Joe Biden keep coming out, in which he looks lost. Sometimes he ignores the rest of the people and turns in the opposite direction, and sometimes he suddenly starts walking in some other direction. Presidential elections are to be held in the US in November this year and the Republican candidate will be Donald Trump, who has also been the President before, in such a situation, Joe Biden&#39;s health has become a cause of trouble for the Democrats. Now something has happened that US President Joe Biden failed to recognize the country&#39;s Vice-President Kamala Harris and Ukraine&#39;s President Volodymyr Zelensky. That too when Kamala Harris had contested the election along with him, and the US is helping Ukraine with millions of dollars in the midst of the war with Russia. In fact, the new drama happened in the news conference held during the NATO leaders&#39; summit. In response to the very first question, Joe Biden called Kamala Harris &#39;Vice-President Trump&#39;. Actually, a Reuters journalist had asked Joe Biden that if he withdraws from this election, does Kamala Harris have the ability to defeat Donald Trump? However, Biden has denied several times that he is withdrawing from the election. In response to the question, Biden said, &quot;Look, I would not have chosen Vice President Trump to become Vice President if I felt that he was not capable of becoming President.&quot; Let us tell you that Joe Biden is 81 years old and has become the oldest President of America.
