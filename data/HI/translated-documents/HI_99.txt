Listen to this news Concerns continue about the possibility of use of nuclear weapons in the Russia-Ukraine war. Meanwhile, the Kremlin has said that if Russia faces an &#39;existential threat&#39;, it will use nuclear weapons. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has given this information. 27 days have passed since the ongoing conflict between the two neighboring countries. In an interview to CNN International on Tuesday, Peskov said that if we face an &#39;existential threat&#39;, we will use nuclear weapons only. He said, &#39;Our view is of domestic security and it is public. You can read about all the reasons for the use of nuclear weapons. He said, &#39;So if there is a threat to the existence of our country, then according to our concept, it can be used.&#39; Regarding Russia&#39;s activities in Ukraine, Peskov said that their aim is not to occupy the neighbor. At the same time, he stressed that his country is not targeting civilians. The spokesperson said that the main objective of the &#39;action&#39; is to &#39;get rid of Ukraine&#39;s military forces.&#39; He said, &#39;That&#39;s why our army is targeting only military targets and military related things on Ukrainian soil, not civilians.&#39; A few days after attacking Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that he had put the country&#39;s strategic nuclear forces on high alert. Since this announcement on February 28, concerns had increased worldwide. On Peskov&#39;s statement, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby has described Moscow&#39;s possible use of nuclear weapons as &#39;dangerous&#39;. He said, &#39;This should not be the way a responsible nuclear power works.&#39; The special thing is that Russia has the world&#39;s largest stockpile of nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, defense officials of Western countries say that after Putin&#39;s announcement in February, they have not seen any activities related to the mobilization of Russia&#39;s nuclear forces. Whereas, Moscow has also issued a warning that if the US and NATO allies provide fighter jets to Ukraine, it can intensify and expand the war. Beatrice Finn, leader of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, had warned that Putin is using nuclear &#39;blackmail&#39; to keep Western countries away from attacking Ukraine.
