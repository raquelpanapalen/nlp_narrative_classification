The United Nations Charter says that every country should respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all other countries. Zelensky told the United Nations Security Council that Russian President Vladimir Putin is committing an international crime. He has broken so many international rules that he will not stop on his own. Zelensky said that this is why this war cannot end easily. It cannot be pacified by talks. Russia can only be forced to peace. Ministers from 14 of the 15 member countries of the Council participated in a high-level meeting on the war going on for two and a half years in Ukraine. Russia sent its low-level UN ambassador to the meeting. At the beginning of the meeting, Vasily Nebenzya protested that Zelensky was again being given an opportunity to attract the attention of the UN. He also criticized Slovenia, which is chairing the council this month, for allowing the Ukrainian leader to repeat the same old things. At the same time, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres reiterated the UN&#39;s strong support for Ukraine&#39;s sovereignty and territorial integrity under the charter of the world body.
