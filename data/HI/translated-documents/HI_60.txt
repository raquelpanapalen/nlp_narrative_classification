Financial Times started crying again over oil purchase The Indian government has been continuously making it clear since 2022 that the purchase of oil from Russia is only a part of its total purchases. Foreign Minister S Jaishankar had once exposed the double standards of Western countries regarding this. He had said in a public conversation, &quot;We buy some crude oil and gas, which is necessary for our energy security. But looking at the figures, it seems to me that Europe buys more in a day than we buy in a month.&quot; Ignoring this, the propaganda of Financial Times came to the fore. Financial Times claimed that India has indirectly helped Russia to keep the war going by purchasing. It said that India&#39;s purchase of oil from Russia came as a boon after the sanctions of Western countries on Russia. Financial Times wrote, &quot;India has been a major buyer of Russian crude oil and the total trade of the two countries reached the level of $ 66 billion in 2023-24, which is a five-fold increase compared to the year before Ukraine-Russia. Some of this trade has been done in rupees, leaving Russia with reserves. According to business people and Western officials, Russian companies have used these rupee reserves to trade gold and buy goods to avoid sanctions.
