Russia and China came closer due to the fear of Storm Shadow and ATACAMS! Will the decision be taken on the battlefield with America now? It is claimed that even a bombproof bunker becomes useless in front of this missile. Be it a warship floating in the sea or the enemy&#39;s command center. This one missile is the only answer to all targets. When it moves towards the target, it does not need the help of the control room. It finds the victim while avoiding the radar. Ukraine may get a new gift of deadly missiles from America and European countries. This news has increased Putin&#39;s tension. Russia has directly threatened America. Putin has also talked about giving a befitting reply. There are many speculations about this answer. It is being claimed that Putin&#39;s action may cost America dearly. Putin, who is furious with the American help being given to Ukraine, is now eager to defeat America in the battlefield instead of the field of diplomacy. In such a situation, Russia has joined China (Russia China deal). Ukraine has been overshadowing Russia for some time now. On the strength of its weapons, America has become Bhasmasura and is creating havoc of death. One missile of America has made Putin&#39;s life so difficult that it seems as if he has directly threatened to take on Biden. The deadly missile that is bothering Russia is named ATACAMS. It can strike up to 300 kilometers away. Right now Ukraine has a short version of this missile. But it is claimed that soon America and other western countries can also give it long range missiles. Long range will directly mean that it will become difficult for Russia to avoid Ukraine&#39;s attacks and the Ukrainian army will be able to attack even those areas which are currently out of its range.
