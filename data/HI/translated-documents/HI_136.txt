The Legal Risk of Advertising Carbon &#39;Offsets&#39;: Risks and Compliance Considerations… Are you promoting carbon offsets to balance your company’s carbon footprint? Be mindful of the legal risks and compliance challenges that come with this green marketing strategy. From false advertising to fraud, there are many ways your carbon offset claims could land you in contention with regulators and consumers. In this article, we’ll explore the legal landscape of carbon offsets and highlight the key risks and compliance considerations you need to know. We’ll cover topics such as FTC guidelines, state and federal laws, voluntary standards, and best practices for transparency and verification. Don’t let your good intentions fail – read on to learn how to deal with the legal risks of advertising carbon offsets. What Are Carbon Offsets? Carbon offsetting is the process of using “carbon offsets” or “carbon credits” to compensate for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that were produced elsewhere. Many businesses are incorporating carbon offsets into their sustainability and carbon reduction plans. A carbon credit is a tradable certificate that certifies the removal of one metric ton of carbon dioxide (or an equivalent amount of another GHG) from the atmosphere. A regulator or other competent, independent organization must approve the certificate. It is possible to claim emissions reductions using carbon credits. To prevent double counting, used goods must be “retired” and removed from the market. Many businesses use the notion of carbon offsetting to claim that their emissions have been balanced or that their products are “carbon neutral”. This often involves making a small contribution to projects that address climate change, often planting or protecting trees, in exchange for fictitious “carbon credits”. The idea behind it is straightforward: by funding initiatives that reduce carbon emissions, you can either make a product “greener” or enable a business to achieve net zero emissions. Why is the marketing of carbon “offsets” problematic? One ton of CO2 is equivalent to roughly the same amount of carbon dioxide emitted in a trip from Paris to New York, and one ton of CO2 carbon credits are predicted to eliminate or avoid. Purchasing these credits supports initiatives to reduce climate instability by supporting innovative natural or technological solutions. These environmental initiatives can be helpful in the fight against climate change. Protecting important natural habitats, including forests, which serve as &quot;carbon sinks&quot; by absorbing harmful greenhouse gases, is aided by good examples that help local populations. Still, &quot;quality&quot; can be difficult to find in the unregulated carbon credit market and even more challenging to verify. Too many projects have been discovered that hurt the interests of local communities and make misleading claims that they are actually reducing the amount of CO2 absorbed and stored. This industry is often referred to as the &quot;Wild West&quot;. Another problem is that there is not enough space on Earth to grow as many trees as would be needed to balance current levels of emissions without compromising food supplies. To put this in perspective, an oil and gas corporation intends to “offset” its emissions by using one-tenth of the world’s accessible undeveloped land. Improving natural sinks will only take us so far; with massive emissions reductions, reaching net zero by 2050 is feasible. Carbon credits do not offset losses like profits. The true description of these credits is simply a gift for climate-friendly initiatives, not, as marketing for high-carbon products often implies, as a way to “balance out” the adverse effects of the products we buy on the environment. What is the legal risk of advertising carbon “offsets”? The legal risk of offsetting marketing is growing, but so is the possibility that we could miss opportunities to cut emissions in the real world. Cash should be allocated to initiatives protecting the planet’s essential ecosystems and green technologies to achieve climate goals and bridge the huge financing gap for climate loss and damage. This is where the financial contribution made through carbon credits can be helpful, but financial incentives must be used appropriately to prolong the necessary reduction actions. For carbon credits to be helpful for a future with a livable climate it must be kept separate from emissions reduction plans. Stopping the release of greenhouse gases at the current catastrophic rate is the only way to solve this disaster. By artificially offsetting the image, we only postpone that crucial action. The risk with carbon offsetting is attracting greater legal risk than the deception of carbon offsetting, including risk from shareholder action, non-compliance, litigation and regulatory enforcement. Shell has received two consecutive reprimands in the Netherlands, first for marketing a &quot;CO2-neutral&quot; automobile fuel and then for attempting a separate claim that carbon credits mean &quot;CO2 compensation.&quot; The business unsuccessfully convinced the Dutch advertising watchdog that the facts support the offsetting advertising in both cases. Client Earth is defending a lawsuit against airline KLM for violating consumer law with its CO2 compensation marketing. A case has been filed in Germany against eight businesses, including TotalEnergies, for making false claims about their &quot;carbon neutral&quot; status. According to legal scholars, the use of offsets in marketing claims goes against the requirements of European consumer law. The EU Commission has created a new &quot;anti-greenwashing&quot; consumer rule to tighten restrictions on claims that products are &quot;carbon neutral&quot;. In France, the legislature passed a bill requiring businesses to disclose how emissions are actually reduced before making compensation, after the People&#39;s Assembly banned &quot;carbon neutral&quot; claims. The French advertising watchdog has taken action in response to ambiguous statements made regarding fossil fuels based on carbon credits, saying marketing &#39;carbon offsets&#39; exaggerates the impact of buying petrol. Competition lawyers have also noted the potential for violations of competition (antitrust) rules with situations of greenwashing among competitors. What are the FTC guidelines for advertising carbon offsets? The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has issued guidelines to help companies avoid deceptive or misleading claims when advertising carbon offsets. These guidelines apply to all types of advertising, including websites, brochures, and social media. Here are some key points to consider: Substantiation: Companies must have a reasonable basis for any carbon offset claim they make. This means they must have competent and reliable scientific evidence to support their claims. Qualifications and disclosures: Companies must disclose any significant limitations or qualifications that could affect the carbon offset claim, such as the specific methodologies used, the timing and location of the offset, and the possibility of reversal. Clear language: Companies must use clear and specific language to describe their carbon offset claims, avoiding vague or exaggerated terms that could mislead consumers. Comparisons: Companies should avoid making unfair or misleading comparisons between their carbon offsets and other products or services, such as claiming to be “100% carbon neutral” without disclosing the offset’s limitations. Monitoring and Verification: Companies should have a system in place to monitor and verify the carbon offset projects they support and disclose the results to consumers. Failure to comply with these guidelines could result in enforcement actions by the FTC, including fines and injunctions. Therefore, it is essential to consult legal counsel and sustainability experts when advertising carbon offsets to ensure compliance with these guidelines and other relevant laws and regulations. Bottom Line Emissions reduction is essential to meeting climate goals; however, using carbon credits to “offset” or “neutralize” a company’s or product’s impact is problematic. Although it is imperative to direct funds to advance carbon sinks and support carbon removal technologies, encouraging financial support should not delay reducing emissions. Many businesses are already taking actions that are consistent with this, such as purchasing carbon credits independent of reduction targets and based on historical emissions. Carbon credits are needed to separate reductions from contributions. Both firm emission reduction targets and the marketing of high-carbon products need clarity and transparency. One option to reduce transparency is to use carbon credits as “offsets.” Using “offsetting” for “green” high-carbon products and concealing corporate decarbonization intentions poses real and growing threats from a legal and regulatory perspective.
