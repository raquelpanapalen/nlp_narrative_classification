How did Bengaluru and Pune change from &#39;pleasant weather&#39; to hot cities? What should be the way to protect yourself? In the month of April 2024, for the first time in at least the last 41 years, there was no rain in Bengaluru. In fact, on April 25, the temperature of the city was 38.5 degrees Celsius. This was the second hottest day in 50 years. In the last few years, cities like Bengaluru and Pune are getting hotter. These cities were claimed to have &#39;pleasant&#39; weather throughout the year. According to a notice issued by the Indian Meteorological Department on May 2, the temperature in Pune will be between 40-42 degrees Celsius in the coming days. People of both the cities have recently discussed on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) about how they have to buy or rent air conditioners or coolers due to the rising temperature. Such discussions have rarely been at such a peak in both the metropolises before. &#39;The Urban Heat Island Effect&#39;: The state of &#39;pleasant weather&#39; cities Ranjit Gadgil, environment expert and programme director at &#39;Parisar&#39;, told The Quint, &quot;The broad reason for this is of course climate change and global warming but there are many local reasons too. That is, we should also look at the way we are developing cities.&quot; Shripad Dharmadhikari, a Pune-based environment expert working with the Manthan Study Centre, agrees with Ranjit Gadgil. Dharmadhikari says, &quot;The heat has been increasing here during summers for the last few years but this is the first time we are bearing the brunt of the heat. The weather here has started getting hot much earlier than usual.&quot; Both the experts have pointed out some points regarding the reason for the changing weather, they say that if it is not stopped, it can increase manifold. Increase in construction and skyscrapers Lack of water and greenery in cities Increase in the number of vehicles on the roads, hence the growth of roads A city where water does not seep below the surface level (and hence does not help in cooling the city) Increase in energy consumption and production within cities Sprawl and growth of cities
