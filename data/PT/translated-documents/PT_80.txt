Former leader of neo-Nazi skinheads says Portuguese communists will become "legitimate targets" if their children are called to war

Mário Machado, the notorious former leader of neo-Nazi skinheads in Portugal, who has been sentenced to prison for various crimes, said on social media that if Poland invokes Article 5 of NATO and his three sons of military age are called to "war", all communists in Portugal will become legitimate targets. This is a contradiction in terms, since the Portuguese Communist Party, unlike the parliamentary majority, is against Portugal's integration into NATO, and United Russia, Vladimir Putin's party, has an absolute majority in the Federal Duma (325 seats), is a nationalist, conservative, populist party, affiliated to the Centrist Democratic International, an opponent of the Russian Communist Party, which has only 57 seats.

André Ventura's supporter based his claim on the news that Russia had hit Poland with two missiles, which Poland has now denied, attributing the "unfortunate accident" to Ukraine.

Despite the fact that Russia hasn't been communist for many years, and despite the fact that there are several Cheganos who are also on Putin's side, such as Maria Vieira, the municipal deputy for Chega in Cascais, Mário Machado turns his sights on the Portuguese communists:

Russia hit Poland with two missiles, killing two people. If Poland invokes Article 5 of NATO, and 3 of my sons of military age are called up, all communists in Portugal will become legitimate targets.

Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty:

The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against all of them, and consequently agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each Party, in the exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognized by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, shall assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking without delay, individually and in agreement with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and ensure security in the North Atlantic region.

Any such armed attack and all measures taken as a result thereof shall be immediately reported to the Security Council. Such measures shall cease as soon as the Security Council has taken the necessary steps to restore and maintain international peace and security.
