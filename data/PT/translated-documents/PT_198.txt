COP-27: Brazil has chosen to "stop destroying the Amazon", says Al Gore, former US vice-president

Nobel Peace Prize winner, former US vice-president and climate activist Albert Gore Junior, better known as Al Gore, said on Monday that a few days ago Brazil "chose to stop destroying the Amazon". In a fiery speech at the leaders' summit of the Climate Conference (COP-27), he argued that global leaders have a "trust problem" when it comes to fighting climate change and advocated investment in what he called the "sustainable revolution".

Al Gore did not mention Jair Bolsonaro or Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva by name during his speech. However, on October 30, as soon as the PT candidate's victory was confirmed, the activist congratulated the president-elect on his victory and said that the "world expects renewed leadership from Brazil in driving solutions to the climate crisis and stemming the loss of biodiversity".

"We are discussing and starting to act, but we are not doing enough. It is a choice to continue this pattern of destructive behavior. I believe we have other options," he said.

He stressed that we are in the early stages of a "sustainable revolution", which has the "magnitude of the Industrial Revolution" and the "speed of the digital revolution". "If we invest in this and stop subsidizing the culture of death, we can save ourselves," he said.

"Every dollar spent on renewable energy creates three times more jobs than the dollars spent on fossil energy. And this sustainable revolution is massively deflationary, precisely at a time when the world is trying to find new ways to fight inflation," he argued.
