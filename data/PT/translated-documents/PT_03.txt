At least 20 Polish mercenaries were killed by Russian forces at the front, says fighter

In an interview with Polish radio, a Polish mercenary fighting for Kiev gives a grim account of the situation on the battlefield. Moscow estimates that at least 13387 foreign mercenaries have joined the Kiev regime, of which 5962 have been killed.

At least 20 Polish citizens have been killed while fighting as mercenaries paid by the Kiev regime in the Ukrainian conflict.

The information was provided by Piotr Mitkiewicz, a Pole who works as a mercenary for Ukrainian forces, in an interview on Polish radio RMF's Morning Talk program, when asked about the number of Polish mercenaries at the front.

"There aren't many. I've been there longer and I know most of those who are there. But I will say this: up to 20 of us have died," Mitkiewicz replied.

Mitkiewicz's estimate is lower than that of the Russian Defense Ministry, which estimates that around 1,497 Polish mercenaries were killed in fighting with Russian forces, out of a total of 2,960 who enlisted to fight for the Kiev regime.

In the interview, Mitkiewicz gave a grim account of the situation on the battlefield, saying that "all you want to do is kill".

"There are mines under your feet. A man can come within 30 meters of you and throw a grenade. 100 meters away, there's a man with an [AK-47 Kalashnikov]. There's a guy standing 400 meters away with a heavy machine gun, he wants to kill you too. There's a sniper 800 meters away. A tank is firing two kilometers away and there's artillery 10 kilometers away, also firing at you."

Moscow estimates that at least 13387 foreign fighters have taken up arms on behalf of the Kiev regime, of whom 5962 have been killed. Although Poland accounted for most of the mercenaries, the US was second on the list with 1113 fighters, of whom at least 491 were killed, according to Russian military estimates.
