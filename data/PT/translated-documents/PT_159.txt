The energy transition

Extreme weather events are multiplying. There are huge forest fires, severe droughts, torrential rains, massive floods, violent heat waves, etc. Portugal is already feeling some of the unpleasant effects of climate change, effects that are dramatic in other European countries, the United States, Canada, China...

How is it possible to ignore such clear signs and consider that the energy transition should be halted by consuming more fossil fuels? This is a regrettable reaction that is taking place in several European countries.

It's a way of denying what is obvious. Years ago it was still possible to consider the imperative to reduce CO2 emissions a fantasy. Now, denying what is plain to see requires a greater effort, which, however, some make in order not to be bothered.

The energy transition has costs, which it is more comfortable to ignore. Those who react in this way probably think that the final tragedy will only happen when they are no longer around. This condemns future generations. This is irresponsible selfishness.

Unfortunately, political leaders are not always up to the task of dealing with the advancing crisis. They prefer not to bother people and so avoid the drastic measures that are needed.

That's why the hope lies in the young generation's ability to protest, in order to force politicians to assume their responsibilities, instead of quietly continuing to act as if the energy transition wasn't urgent.

Young people are protesting because their lives are at risk. They are right. Everyone, young and old, should be grateful to those who don't resign themselves to passively waiting for the worst to happen.
