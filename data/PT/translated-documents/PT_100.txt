NASA study indicates that the Northeast and much of Brazil could be uninhabitable in 50 years' time

A study carried out by NASA researchers has revealed that a large part of Brazil could become uninhabitable within 50 years, due to rising temperatures on the planet. In addition to Brazil, territories in Asia and the Middle East are also at risk of becoming inhospitable.

Published in the journal Science Advances, the analysis was developed by the team of researcher Colin Raymond, from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. To arrive at the results, the scientists observed extremes of heat and humidity across the globe, using satellite images and wet bulb temperature projections, a method that allows the measurement of humidity in the air.

It is important to analyze humidity because, when it is excessive, it hinders the evaporation of sweat, which impairs the body's ability to dissipate heat and, consequently, overheats the body. In this way, the combination of high humidity levels and extreme temperatures can be lethal.

AFFECTED REGIONS

According to the US space agency's research, the Midwest, Northeast, North and Southeast regions of Brazil will be the most affected.

There is no exact date to determine when conditions in these places will become hostile, but scientists believe that the process is likely to take place over the next few decades, driven by deforestation and the reckless consumption of natural resources.

In addition to Brazil, parts of Southeast Asia will also suffer the consequences of global warming, and could experience worrying combinations of temperature and humidity by 2070.

In the Middle East, the regions around the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea are the most at risk. Known for their already high temperatures, these places will see thermometers rise even higher in the coming decades and could become uninhabitable within the next 46 years.
