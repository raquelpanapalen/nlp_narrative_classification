Ukraine responds to Hungary: Russian oil blockade "not blackmail"

Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak assured on Friday that the decision to stop the transit of Russian oil from the Lukoil company through its territory "has nothing to do with blackmail", but with Kyiv sanctions.

The statement by Volodymyr Zelensky's advisor, sent to the Reuters news agency, comes after Hungary and Slovakia asked the European Commission to mediate with Ukraine, which has included the Lukoil oil company on its sanctions list, causing the transit of oil to the two countries via the Druzhba pipeline to cease.

On Monday, Hungarian government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs warned that "Ukraine's decision not to allow Lukoil to transit oil through Ukraine implies a fundamental threat to the security of energy supplies to Hungary and Slovakia".

Already this Friday, at a press conference, Gergely Gulyas, head of the Hungarian Prime Minister's office, said that Ukraine was blackmailing Hungary and Slovakia who "stand for peace and ceasefire".

However, Podolyak has now assured that "the situation with the suspension of Russian oil transit through the Druzhba pipeline to Hungary and Slovakia has nothing to do with blackmail in the Ukrainian version," Podolyak said in a written comment.

"Hungary and Slovakia do not present themselves as true guardians of peace and do not insist on peace and justice, but only on concessions to Russia," he shot back.

It should be noted that Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n and his Slovak counterpart Robert Fico, both defined as "pro-Russian", have opposed military support for Ukraine following the Russian invasion and advocate a negotiated solution to end the conflict.

Both countries depend essentially on Russian oil imports, and although the sanctions on Lukoil have affected the exchange, both countries continue to receive supplies from other Russian companies.
