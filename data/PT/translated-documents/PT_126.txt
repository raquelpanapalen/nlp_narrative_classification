Suspect in recent Moscow attack collaborated with Ukraine

According to the FSB note accompanied by a video and published this Friday on its Telegram channel, the individual confessed that he had had links with Ukrainian security since February 2023.

Earlier, the FSB reported that Evgeny Serebriakov, who was involved in the explosion of a car in northern Moscow on July 24, was deported this Friday to Turkey, where he fled after committing the crime.

Born in 1995, Serebriakov was captured on Thursday in the Turkish city of Bodrum thanks to the interaction of Turkish and Russian security forces, who issued an international search and arrest warrant against him.

During an initial interrogation, the subject said that, on his own initiative, he contacted the administrator of a social media channel "to collaborate with the Ukrainian special services" and that he subsequently established communication with a certain Ilia, an alleged agent of that country's security service.

The two communicated via the Wire instant messaging application, which allows encrypted messages to be sent, and on one occasion they met in Istanbul.

In the video released by the FSB, Serebriakov revealed that his alleged Ukrainian contact "proposed eliminating an officer", for which he collected components of an explosive device west of Moscow.

"On the advice and under the control of Illah, I made an explosive device and installed it under a car," he confessed.

On Wednesday, at around 6 a.m. Moscow time, the explosion of a bomb attached to a car injured two people, a man and a woman, in a residential neighborhood in northern Moscow.

Serebriakov managed to escape to Turkey on a commercial flight and arrived there as a tourist. That same day, the Russian authorities issued an international search and arrest warrant for the suspect.

One of the lines of investigation, according to the FSB, is that the attack was related to the professional activity of one of the victims.
