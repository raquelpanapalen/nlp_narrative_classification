Lula makes federal government available to help towns in Rio Grande do Sul affected by flooding

President Lula has spoken out about the flooding that hit several regions of Rio Grande do Sul between Monday and Tuesday. In the "Conversation with the President" program, he spoke about the situations in the municipalities of the Serra and the north of the state and guaranteed federal aid.

"We now have an excess of rain. It's rained a lot in various regions, there's flooding and from what I've seen there are deaths. I want to make an announcement to the people of Rio Grande do Sul that the head of Civil Defense is going to Rio Grande do Sul. I'd like to tell the people of Rio Grande do Sul that we're ready to help in any way necessary. Wherever there is a problem, the federal government will be ready to help people", he assured.

Lula recalled that, in the first half of the year, a delegation of ministers visited the state to see the damage caused by the drought, which affected 400 municipalities and impacted agricultural production. In February, the federal government released 392.8 million euros for mitigation actions. In March, 12 towns in Rio Grande do Sul affected by the drought received a further 360 million euros in aid.

For the president, these extreme events are a reminder that the climate issue is not a minor matter. "It's not a question of university professors, it's not a question of environmentalists, it's a question of humanity, of the planet suffering the consequences of human irresponsibility," he said, reaffirming that he has plans to put the subject of climate change on the school curriculum.

Earlier on Tuesday, Lula used Twitter to express his solidarity with the families who lost people in the floods in Rio Grande do Sul.
