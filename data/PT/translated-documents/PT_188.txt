Environmental crisis in the Pantanal: drought and deforestation devastate the biome

The Pantanal, one of the largest wetlands on the planet, is facing an unprecedented environmental crisis.

The combination of deforestation and prolonged droughts has led to an alarming reduction in surface water, affecting not only local biodiversity, but also the communities that depend on these natural resources.

A recent study by the MapBiomas platform highlights that, in the current century, almost every year has seen a decrease in the surface area of water in Brazil, with the Pantanal and Cerrado being the most affected biomes.

Experts warn of the risk of severe drought and a possible water collapse, a direct consequence of neglecting springs and riparian forests, which are essential for rain to percolate into the ground and maintain river flow.

Deforestation in the Amazon, which affects the formation of rainfall through evapotranspiration, also contributes significantly to drought in the Pantanal, creating ideal conditions for the spread of devastating fires. These fires, in turn, further compromise the structure of the soil and reduce the amount of water available in the water table.

The situation is exacerbated by the fact that the Pantanal has lost 29% of its water surface, with 57% of its territory having been burned at least once in the last 36 years. This loss not only signals a decline in the health of the biome, but also reflects the profound climate changes that are taking place at a global level. The ebb and flow of the Paraguay River, which is registering levels close to historic lows, is yet another indicator of the seriousness of the situation.

The impact of these changes goes beyond environmental degradation, also affecting the economy and society, with damage that overlaps and amplifies the challenges faced by the region.

It is imperative that measures are taken to mitigate these effects and protect the Pantanal for future generations. Raising awareness of the importance of the ecosystem services provided by biomes such as the Pantanal and the Amazon is a crucial step in this process.

The preservation of these ecosystems is not just a matter of nature conservation, but a necessity for the sustainability of our very way of life.
