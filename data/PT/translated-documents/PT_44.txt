Kiev could lose all access to the Black Sea if it doesn't agree to negotiations with Russia, says Musk

US billionaire and entrepreneur Elon Musk believes that if Ukraine doesn't agree to negotiate with Russia, the country could lose all access to the Black Sea. According to Musk, the longer the conflict lasts, "the more territory Russia will gain".

"If the war lasts long enough, Odessa will fall. In my opinion, the main question is whether Ukraine will lose all access to the Black Sea or not. I would advise resolving the conflict through negotiations before that happens," Musk said on the X social network.

According to the entrepreneur, "attacking a larger army with deep defense, minefields and strong artillery, when Ukraine had no superiority either in armor or in the air, was a tragedy in terms of loss of life."

Moscow has repeatedly indicated that it is willing to negotiate, while Kiev has banned any talks to bring the conflict to an end. The West, which supports the government of President Vladimir Zelensky, is pressuring the country not to start negotiations.

Earlier, the Russian government stated that there are no prerequisites for a peaceful solution, with the realization of the objectives of the special operation, which can currently only be achieved militarily.

The situation in Ukraine can become peaceful only if the new realities and the de facto situation are taken into account, all of Moscow's requirements are well known.

Russia began military action in Ukraine on February 24, 2022. President Vladimir Putin justified the move by the need to "protect people who have been subjected to abuse and genocide by the Kiev regime for eight years". To this end, according to Putin, it is planned to carry out a "demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine", bring to justice all war criminals responsible for "bloody crimes against civilians".
