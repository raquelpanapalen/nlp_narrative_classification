Ukrainian drone attack causes fire at Russian refinery

A drone attack launched by Ukraine overnight caused a fire at an oil refinery and killed one person in southern Russia, Russian and Ukrainian authorities said on Monday (22).

Kiev and Moscow have stepped up their mutual cross-border attacks, both with missiles and drones, in recent months, mainly targeting energy infrastructure.

The Russian regional authorities of the Black Sea and the town of Tuapse in the Krasnodar region (south) explained that falling drone debris caused a fire at a refinery, which forced the mobilization of a hundred firefighters.

The governor of Belgorod, another region in southern Russia, reported that a person driving a tractor was killed by a Ukrainian drone and that his wife was injured.

A source in the Ukrainian defense sector said that drones related to military intelligence were used and that the damaged refinery is operated by the Russian state giant Rosneft.

"The extent of the damage to the military-industrial complex of the aggressor state is being proven," the source said in a written statement.

According to the Russian Defense Ministry, 75 Ukrainian drones were shot down during the night, 47 of them in the southern region of Rostov, another in Belgorod, two more in Voronej and Smolensk and eight in the sky over Krasnodar.

Another 17 drones were shot down while flying over the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, according to the Ministry.

Russia announces almost daily that it has shot down Ukrainian drones on its territory.

According to Kiev, these attacks are a response to Russian bombardments as part of the invasion of the country launched by Moscow in February 2022.

Ukraine has indicated that its forces shot down 16 drones overnight.
