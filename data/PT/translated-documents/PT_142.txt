Around 20 countries call for a tripling of global nuclear power by 2050

The announcement was made by John Kerry, the United States' climate envoy, during the 28th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28), which runs until December 12 in Dubai.

China and Russia, the world's largest nuclear power plant builders, are not among the signatories.

In addition to the United States, France and the United Arab Emirates, Bulgaria, Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Ghana, Hungary, Japan, Moldova, Mongolia, Morocco, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Ukraine, South Korea and the United Kingdom signed the declaration.

"The declaration recognizes the fundamental role of nuclear energy in achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 and in maintaining the goal of (limiting global warming to) 1.5Â°C," the text states.

"We know from the science, the facts and the evidence that we cannot achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 without nuclear power," said John Kerry.

The President of Romania, Clausus Johannites, explained that nuclear energy represents for the European country "a stable source of energy that contributes to energy security and decarbonization".

The signatory countries are also calling on international financial institutions, such as the World Bank, to include nuclear energy in approved financing.

"There are statutory provisions, sometimes in certain international credit institutions, which exclude nuclear energy. I think that's completely obsolete," Rafael Grossi, Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), told France-Presse.

Proponents of nuclear energy say that it is flexible, emits virtually no greenhouse gases and is an incomparable means of producing clean and abundant electricity.

On the other side, some environmentalists point out negative points, such as the risk of accidents and the high cost of this energy.
