Putin warns US of Cold War-style missile crisis

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin warned the United States on Sunday that if Washington deploys long-range missiles in Germany, Russia will position similar missiles within striking distance of the West.

The United States said on July 10 that it would begin deploying long-range missiles in Germany from 2026, in preparation for a long-term deployment that will include SM-6s, Tomahawk cruise missiles and hypersonic weapons under development.

In a speech to sailors from Russia, China, Algeria and India to mark Russian Navy Day in the former imperial capital of St. Petersburg, Putin warned the United States that they risk triggering a Cold War-style missile crisis with the announcement.

"The flight time to targets of such missiles on our territory, which in the future could be equipped with nuclear warheads, will be about 10 minutes," Putin said.

"We will take mirror measures, taking into account the actions of the United States, its satellites in Europe and other regions of the world."

Putin, who sent his army to Ukraine in 2022, considers the war to be part of a historic struggle with the West, which he says humiliated Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 by invading what he considers to be Moscow's sphere of influence.

Ukraine and the West say Putin is involved in an imperial-style land grab. They have vowed to defeat Russia, which currently controls around 18% of Ukraine, including Crimea, and chunks of four eastern Ukrainian regions.

Russia says that the lands, which were once part of the Russian empire, are now part of Russia again and will never be returned.
