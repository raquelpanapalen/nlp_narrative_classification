Brazil is among the places that could become uninhabitable in 50 years, says NASA

Wet-bulb temperatures are rising around the world, and the Earth's climate has begun to exceed the 35ºC limit.

A study by NASA, the US space agency, has shown that some places in the world could become uninhabitable in the coming decades because of climate change. According to the report, areas of the Midwest, Northeast, North and Southeast of Brazil are included in a study that mapped five regions.

Colin Raymond, from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and author of a 2020 study on extreme heat and humidity, analyzes that "climate models tell us that certain regions are likely to exceed these temperatures [35ºC] in the next 30 to 50 years".

In addition to Brazil, Raymond cites South and parts of Southeast Asia, eastern China, the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea. The USA is not immune either: in 50 years' time, the country's mid-western states, such as Arkansas, Missouri and Iowa, will probably also be in a critical situation.

The 35ºC referred to in the survey refers to the wet bulb temperature used as a standard for measuring heat and humidity, especially in long-term global climate surveys.

According to Raymond, this is the highest wet bulb temperature that humans can survive when exposed for at least six hours.

Wet bulb temperatures are rising all over the world, and the Earth's climate has begun to cross this 35ºC threshold. This means that the hotter it gets, the more tension our bodies feel, and the more we need to sweat to cool down.
