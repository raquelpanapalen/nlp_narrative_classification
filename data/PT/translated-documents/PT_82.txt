Lisbon court withdrew coercion measures against the historic leader of the Neo-Nazi Skinheads to go fight in Ukraine

It's true, just when you thought justice couldn't surprise, it does, and it's estimated that there are victims of racism and xenophobia who wish that Mário Machado, the historic leader of the neo-Nazi skinheads and a supporter of André Ventura's Chega, wouldn't mince his words and would join the Ukrainian troops as soon as possible, preferably on the front line.

Mário Machado shared the request and the court's decision to withdraw the coercive measure of fortnightly presentation of the crime of possession of a prohibited weapon and wrote:

Breaking news!!!

The judge of the Lisbon Criminal Investigation Court has rejected Mário Machado's request to change the coercive measures applied in the last political process of fortnightly presentations.

Machado requested the following through his illustrious lawyer, Dr. José M. Castro"...The serious international crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine has mobilized the efforts of thousands of people, mainly in the humanitarian field.

The defendant is not indifferent to this movement.

He has therefore mobilized a group of people of various nationalities who are proposing to go to Ukraine to provide humanitarian aid and, if necessary, to fight alongside Ukrainian troops."

The judge made the order: "...considering the humanitarian situation in Ukraine and the purposes invoked by the defendant for his claim, the defendant may no longer comply with the aforementioned coercive measure while he is abroad."
