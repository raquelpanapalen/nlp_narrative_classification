10 days after protests against Lula with Ukrainian flags, André Ventura shares photo with Putin ally

It still seems like yesterday that 3 Chega MPs carried placards with Ukrainian flags as a protest against Lula da Silva, but it was actually 10 days ago that this happened.

Perhaps to celebrate this initiative in defense of the Ukrainian people, André Ventura shared a photo today with the President of Hungary and one of Putin's main allies in Europe, as evidenced by his statements and positions, which are much more denunciatory in defending Russia against Ukraine than Lula da Silva.

In January 2023 Viktor Orbán said that "Ukraine cannot win even with Western help", in February the Hungarian Prime Minister accused the EU and NATO of being in favor of war in Ukraine and in March this year his government declared that it does not intend to comply with the ICC's request for Putin's arrest if the Russian leader visits Hungary.

André Ventura shared a photo of Viktor Orbán in his jersey today and wrote:

I met with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán this morning and we talked about the European elections, the future of the right and the European Union. We also talked about soccer but I can't reveal that conversation ????
