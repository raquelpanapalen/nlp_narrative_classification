Russia takes control of another settlement in eastern Ukraine

The Russian Defense Ministry announced on Saturday that Russian forces have taken control of the village of Lozuvatske in the Pokrovsk sector of Ukraine's Donetsk region, the site of some of the fiercest frontline battles in the 29-month-old war.

The Ukrainian General Staff did not mention the settlement in its report, but pointed out that the area around it had been taken over by heavy fighting. Unofficial military sources reported the loss of at least two other locations in the sector.

Russian forces have been slowly advancing through the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine, with steady, incremental gains since they took the key town of Avdiivka in February.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that Russia's "core" group of forces captured Lozuvatske, northwest of the regional center of Donetsk, which is controlled by the Russians.

Russia also said that its forces launched attacks on other locations in the sector and repelled three Ukrainian counter-attacks.

The Ukrainian authorities have been reporting for several weeks that the Pokrovsk sector is being gripped by the heaviest fighting along the thousand-kilometer front line.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy discussed the sector twice on Thursday with his top commander, Olexandr Syrskyi.

The Ukrainian General Staff reported on Saturday that Ukrainian forces had repelled 17 attacks in the area, with 10 clashes still ongoing.

"The situation is difficult, but it is under the control of the armed forces," the report said.

Ukraine's popular unofficial military blog, DeepState, made no reference to Lozuvatske in its last published text, but in the last two days has reported the fall of two villages in the sector - Prohres and Vovche.
