Kremlin welcomes Trump's comments that Russia is a "war machine", but keeps its eyes open for the Republican

The Kremlin said on Friday it welcomed Republican US presidential candidate Donald Trump's comments about Russia being "a war machine" that defeated Napoleon Bonaparte and Adolf Hitler, but said it was not wearing rose-colored glasses when it came to the Republican candidate.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was answering a question about comments Trump said he made to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a phone call on July 19.

Trump later told Fox News that he had told Zelenskiy that the war had to be ended.

"This is a war machine that you're up against. That's what they (the Russians) do, they fight wars. They beat Hitler. They beat Napoleon. We have to end this war," said Trump.

Commenting on Trump's remarks, Peskov said: "It will probably be useful for the majority of the American public to know that there are many glorious pages in Russian history and, in fact, probably few people in the US, i.e. ordinary Americans and perhaps representatives of the so-called political establishment, know history in such depth."

But Peskov, when asked afterwards about a comment in the Wall Street Journal co-authored by Mike Pompeo, Trump's former secretary of state, said that the Kremlin had its eyes open when it came to assessing what a Trump presidency could mean for Russia.

Pompeo's comment suggested that Trump would enact tough new sanctions against Moscow if elected and increase aid to Ukraine.

"We never wore and don't wear rose-colored glasses. (Trump) is a representative of the US political elite, which is now absolutely suffering from totally anti-Russian sentiment," Peskov said.

"When he was president, under Trump, the Americans started this sanctions race, under Trump a huge number of sanctions were imposed against our country, and in that respect he is not much different for us from everyone else."
