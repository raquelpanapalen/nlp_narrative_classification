Kyiv claims drone attack on refinery in Russia

A Ukrainian defense source said that several drones attacked the refinery in Tuapse, a town on the shores of the Black Sea in Russia's Krasnodar region (southwest), causing a fire.

"The extent of the damage is being clarified," said the Ukrainian source, specifying that it is a refinery owned by Russian giant Rosneft, equipped with a port terminal and that almost 90% of its production is destined for export.

On the Telegram social network, the Russian regional authorities said that the fire at the refinery was caused by "falling debris from drones".

"The Kyiv regime has once again tried to attack civilian infrastructure in Tuapse with drones," the Russian sources said.

Around a hundred rescue teams were mobilized to the scene and brought the flames under control early this morning and, according to preliminary information, there are no casualties.

At the same time, a tractor driver was killed today by a drone and his wife was injured while they were working in an agricultural field near the village of Ustinka, in Russia's Belgorod region (west), according to the local governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, who identified the unmanned aircraft as Ukrainian.

The Russian army announced today that it had shot down 80 Ukrainian drones since Sunday night, including 47 in the southern region of Rostov alone, on the border with Ukraine.

According to this source, one drone was destroyed in Belgorod, another in Voronezh, another in Smolensk, eight in Krasnodar and 17 in the Black and Azov Seas.

In a separate statement, the Russian army added that it had destroyed five drones at around 07:00 (05:00 in Lisbon) over the Astrakan region.

Russia announces almost daily that it has destroyed Ukrainian drones launched against its territory.

Kyiv argues that it is carrying out these attacks in response to the Russian bombardments that have plagued Ukraine since Russia invaded the country in February 2022.
