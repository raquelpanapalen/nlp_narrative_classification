Activists who blocked private jet in Cascais given suspended sentence

The six activists from the Climáximo movement, who blocked a private jet at Cascais airfield in 2023, were sentenced this Monday to 15 months in prison, 135 days of community service and the payment of 5,300.59 euros.

In a statement sent to the press, the environmental group said that the sentencing took place this Monday morning, in "the same month that the temperature broke the world record twice in a row". "Seven months ago, while governments and fossil companies were meeting at COP28, to which they flew en masse by private jet for another round of false promises, Climáximo supporters entered the Cascais airfield, painted a private jet with red paint and blocked it with their bodies",

The six activists were tried for, in December 2023, blocking a private jet at Cascais airfield to denounce the "superfluous and luxurious flights of the super-rich, and the use of these weapons of mass destruction, whose emissions are killing people all over the world".

Climáximo recalls that, "seven months ago, while governments and fossil companies were meeting at COP28, to which they flew en masse by private jet for yet another round of false promises, Climáximo supporters entered the Cascais airfield, painted a private jet with red paint and blocked it with their bodies".

The group stresses that this sentence does not intimidate its supporters, "nor will it stop the struggle".

One of the convicted activists, quoted in the group's statement, lamented that "today, despite the admission in court of the seriousness of the climate crisis and the impact of disruptive protests, the people who took action to stop the destruction have been convicted, while the real culprits remain unpunished".

Last week, Climáximo supporters were supporting actions at airports in the international uprising for an end to fossil fuels by 2030, as well as the fight in France against the privatization and theft of water by big industries.
