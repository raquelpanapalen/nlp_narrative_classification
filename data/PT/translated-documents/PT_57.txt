Airbus says global fleet could reach 48,230 planes in next 20 years

Company says demand will be driven by wide-body aircraft

Airbus on Monday revised upwards its forecast for aircraft demand over the next 20 years, according to Reuters. According to the agency, which cites an annual report on industry trends, the global fleet could reach 48,230 planes in the next 20 years, which means it could more than double.

According to the document, the world's largest aircraft manufacturer has forecast the delivery of 42,430 new planes over the next 20 years, including 41,490 passenger planes, with an increase of 4% in both figures since the previous study.

The report comes at a time when the aircraft manufacturer's single-aisle, long-range A321XLR is expected to obtain certification in the coming days.

Boeing - which has been embroiled in various controversies in recent times - is developing a long-range version of the 737 MAX.

Airbus' forecasts are based, according to Reuters, on economic forecasts which suggest that 1.7 billion people will enter the middle class, with some disposable income for air travel, in the next 20 years.

"We forecast particularly strong growth in Asia and the Middle East, led above all by India and China. China's domestic traffic will surpass that of the United States," said Bob Lange, head of market analysis and forecasting at Airbus.

The Airbus data underlined the shift of attention to India, with three fastest growing traffic flows serving the Indian subcontinent.

However, post-pandemic aviation growth forecasts have put the industry at odds with environmental groups who dispute its track record in tackling climate change. Airbus argues that the delivery of new planes would help reduce emissions, as greener fuels are being developed.
