Is your favorite destination in danger of disappearing? This is what could happen if sea levels continue to rise

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, climate change will lead to an average rise in global sea levels of between 32 and 84 centimeters by 2100.

Researchers from the financial comparison service Money.co.uk have produced travel posters imagining the impact of dramatically rising sea levels on famous destinations.

Although exaggerated, the artworks are a way of drawing attention to the difficult situation faced by many coastal areas due to rising sea levels.

However, there are several destinations that are likely to be affected by rising sea levels over the next hundred years. The team created a map of tourist destinations around the world that are at risk of flooding and even disappearing altogether.

Fiji, a country where the economy is largely dependent on tourism, has already begun to see the effects of rising sea levels, with research showing that water levels will continue to rise to 1-2 meters by 2100, putting the island at risk of being completely submerged. Seychelles, Solomon Islands and Palau are also at risk of disappearing by 2100, which would be a devastating loss for the planet.

Some of the world's most popular tourist destinations, including London, Dubai, Tokyo and Rio de Janeiro are vulnerable to extreme flooding by 2100. In Dubai, a rise of three meters would cause the city to lose much of its infrastructure. If sea levels rise by nine meters, Dubai could be completely submerged, becoming the shortest-lived urban infrastructure in human history. The Maldives - famous for its iconic overwater villas - could lose up to 77% of its land area to the sea by 2100, according to some experts.
