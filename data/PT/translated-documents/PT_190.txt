Fungi are more resistant to body heat, say researchers; find out what the risks are

There are millions of fungi in the world. Although 150,000 have been catalogued, scientists believe that the real number could vary between 1 and 5 million different species. However, a minority of them present a risk of infection.

The group of researchers investigated 98 infections caused by fungi between 2009 and 2019, recorded in Chinese hospitals. They claim to have discovered a new species that causes infections. "We identified two independent cases of human infection by a previously undescribed invasive fungal pathogen," reads the study. Rhodosporidiobolus fluvialis was the species identified.

In general, high body temperature prevents fungi from surviving. The researchers then carried out tests in laboratories with mice that were induced to a body temperature of 37ºC and found that this species of fungus not only remained alive, but also recorded an increase in mutation rates compared to milder temperatures.

As a result of accelerated mutation, fungi can become even more resistant to drugs, which would make it more difficult to treat any disease. "Temperature-induced mutagenesis can also trigger the development of pan-resistance to three of the most commonly used antifungal drugs (fluconazole, caspofungin and amphotericin B)," say the researchers.

The group also presented the thesis that the increase in global temperature, as a consequence of the climate crisis, may favor the proliferation of infectious diseases. "Global warming may promote the evolution of new fungal pathogens," the article states.

On the other hand, Toni Gabaldón, a biologist at the Barcelona Biomedicine Research Institute, says that caution is needed. "There is a lack of direct evidence that these two observations are related and more research is needed," he told German broadcaster Deutsche Welle.
