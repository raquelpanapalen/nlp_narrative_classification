Chega's National Advisor No. 1 accuses the "President of Ukraine of prolonging the agony of his people"

Jo√£o Tilly has published a video on his YouTube channel about "The Rations and Reasons for Ending the War", where he says that Ukraine has no chance of winning this war, and asks: "What is Zelensky (President of Ukraine) prolonging the resistance for?"

Russia will end up achieving its goals, and the longer it goes on, the more people will die... Zelensky, in order to spare his people, to avoid thousands and thousands of innocent deaths, and I'm not even talking about the military part, the people will still be massacred, when a political leader realizes that his people are in the biggest exodus in their history, 1 million or so a week, it will reach 10 million according to the UN, any leader realizes that his people are fleeing, that leader has a moral and historical obligation to his people, to stop fighting, to spare his people. Let's stop being nationalistic. This is a war that cannot be won or stalemated. What he is doing by resisting is prolonging the agony of his people, and that is very bad, he is subjecting them to a massacre...

Chega's National Advisor No. 1 says that democracy can do nothing against dictatorship, and that if he could talk to the President of Ukraine he would ask him to end the war immediately...

The district chairman of the far-right party says that Putin is a communist, or a fascist, "or both, which is almost the same".
