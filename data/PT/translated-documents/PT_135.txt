In the middle of summer in the northern hemisphere, the world records the hottest day in history

A month after the start of summer in the northern hemisphere, last Sunday, July 21, the world recorded the hottest day in history, according to preliminary data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service, linked to the European Union.

The global average air temperature that Sunday reached 17.09 ºC - slightly above the previous record, set in July last year, of 17.08 ºC.

It may not seem like much, but the rise in temperatures is part of a dangerous trend over the last 13 months, each of which has consecutively broken its respective record compared to the same month in previous years.

In the boreal summer, heatwaves have already begun to hit large areas of the United States, Western Europe - especially in the Mediterranean region - and Russia last week. As well as causing fires in California and Greece to close public monuments, the heat has also raised the temperature of the oceans and caused the earliest and most intense hurricane season in the Atlantic.

Previous record

The Copernicus institute confirmed to the Reuters news agency that the average daily temperature record set last year was broken on Sunday, according to its records, which date back to 1940.

Last year, four consecutive days broke this record, from July 3 to 6. This is the direct result of the effects of climate change, driven by the burning of fossil fuels, which have caused increasingly extreme heat waves and progressively higher temperatures across the planet.

Some scientists suggest that 2024 could surpass 2023 as the hottest year in Earth's history, since climate change and the natural phenomenon El Niño - which ended in April - have increased temperatures even more this year.
