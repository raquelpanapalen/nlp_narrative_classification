'NATO must not cross a red line in Ukraine,' says Slovak defense minister

Slovak Defense Minister Robert Kalinak rejects the idea of sending troops to Ukraine, saying there is a "red line" that must not be crossed.

Kalinak said in an interview with Ta3 News that Western politicians exploit the conflict and the suffering of Ukrainians to achieve their own goals.

The possibility of sending troops into Ukrainian territory was recently raised by French President Emmanuel Macron, who said that the "option" could not be ruled out.

Macron's comments, however, triggered a wave of denials from high-ranking government representatives of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member countries, including the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic, Germany, Finland and Sweden.

The Slovak defense minister warned that sending soldiers from the bloc to Ukraine would "significantly increase the risk of a global conflict". Kalinak added that those "who are serious about supporting Ukraine" should call on "healthy Ukrainians" to return home.

He also called for an end to hostilities between Kiev and Moscow and said that a non-violent exit was necessary. The world is already witnessing the consequences of the conflict "down to the last Ukrainian", said the minister, stressing that "it is time for [the world] to look for peaceful solutions".

Russia has repeatedly said that it is ready for talks, as long as the situation on the ground is on the agenda. Ukraine insists that any negotiations should only begin after Russian forces withdraw from all the territories it claims. Moscow, for its part, considers such demands "absurd".
