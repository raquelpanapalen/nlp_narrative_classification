Italy's Deputy Prime Minister suggests Macron wear a helmet and go to Ukraine

Italy's Minister for Transport and Infrastructure, Matteo Salvini, has suggested that Emmanuel Macron should go to Ukraine and take part in the hostilities.

"I'll tell Macron: go to Ukraine to fight, put on a helmet and don't play with Italians," Salvini said at a campaign event for his party's candidate for mayor of the city.

The League leader has consistently criticized NATO and EU leaders for their stance on increasing military support for Kiev and their willingness to lift restrictions on Ukraine's attacks with Western weapons on the territory of the Russian Federation. The head of EU diplomacy, Josep Borrell Salvini, called Demoman and NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg "Mr. Dangerous".

Macron has previously said that he does not rule out sending troops to Ukraine if Russia breaks the front lines and there is a request from Ukraine. According to him, "many countries" have agreed with France's approach to the possible deployment of troops.

According to the newspaper "Monde", Macron wants to create a European coalition to send military instructors to Ukraine.

The Russian president's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, called the rhetoric from Paris and London about the possibility of sending soldiers to Ukraine dangerous. The Kremlin also said that it drew attention to Macron's words on the subject of sending military personnel to Ukraine in Europe, his position on inflicting a "strategic defeat" on Moscow is also well known. They noted that several countries maintain "a rather sober assessment of the potential dangers of such action and the potential danger of getting directly involved in a hot conflict", this is "not at all in the interests of these countries, they should be aware of this".
