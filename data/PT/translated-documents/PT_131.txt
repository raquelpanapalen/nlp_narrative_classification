Zelensky? "Speaking in a tone about dialog is better than intending to fight"

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's statements about the possibility of talks with Moscow are better than his refusal, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's statements about the possibility of talks with Moscow are better than his refusal.

"In general, of course, it's better than the statements that any contacts with the Russian side and the Russian head of state are excluded. Of course, talking in one tone or another about dialogue is much better than talking about the intention to fight to the last Ukrainian," he said, quoted by Tass.

However, according to Peskov, Russia cannot yet "assess what exactly is behind these words [Zelensky's words about the possibility of negotiations]." "What concrete plans are being talked about and what actions are being taken in this direction, if the conversation is serious," he added.

The Kremlin spokesman also suggested that Russia will "wait for some concrete actions, if any".

It will be recalled that in an interview with the BBC, Zelensky said that talks with the Russian side were possible, despite the decree in force in Ukraine prohibiting such talks. "By putting pressure on Russia, I believe it is possible to reach a diplomatic agreement. I think the power of diplomacy can help," said the Ukrainian president.

On July 15, Zelensky also said that Russian representatives should take part in an upcoming peace conference in Ukraine.
