UN launches new guidelines for dealing with extreme forest fires

The document "Voluntary Guidelines for Integrated Fire Management: Principles and Strategic Actions" updates the UN agency's two-decade-old guidelines and includes new recommendations "to face the challenges arising from the current climate crisis," the organization said in a statement.

By the end of the century, extreme forest fires are expected to become around 50% more frequent and environmental changes linked to climate change, such as more frequent droughts, high temperatures and strong winds, "are likely to result in hotter, drier and longer fire seasons".

According to the FAO, around 340 million to 370 million hectares of the earth's surface are burned by forest fires every year, damaging sustainable development and the livelihoods of communities and causing large volumes of greenhouse gas emissions.

"The way we respond to the challenge of forest fires is fundamental (...). We must shift our focus from reactive responses to proactive strategies and prioritize prevention and preparedness," said the director of the FAO Forestry Division, Zhimin Wu, who launched the new edition of the guide during the 9th World Forest Week in Rome.

The launch of the updated guidelines is "the debut activity" of the Global Fire Management Center, created in 2023 by the FAO and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), with the support of the United States, Canada, France, Germany and Portugal, as well as the Republic of Korea.

The center announced that it has already received funding worth almost five million dollars (4.6 million euros), "essential support for its mission to reduce the adverse effects of forest fires on society, landscapes and the climate."
