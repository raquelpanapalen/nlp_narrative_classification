Extreme heat waves cause more than 175,000 deaths a year in Europe, says WHO

More than 175,000 people die every year in Europe due to the effects of extreme heat waves, according to a statement published this Thursday (1) by the European division of the World Health Organization (WHO).

Among the almost 489,000 heat-related deaths recorded annually between 2000 and 2019 in the world, "the European region accounts for 36%, or an average of 176,040 deaths per year" in this period.

The WHO's Europe region, which stretches as far as Central Asia, is heating up the fastest, about twice the global average, says the organization.

In the last 20 years, heat-related mortality has increased by 30% in the region.

"Extreme temperatures aggravate chronic diseases, including cardiovascular, respiratory and cerebrovascular diseases, mental health and diabetes-related conditions," explains WHO Europe.

They are also responsible for "heat stress", when the human body cannot maintain a temperature between 36 and 37°C, the main cause of climate-related mortality in the region.

According to the WHO, the number of heat-related victims will "skyrocket" in the coming years due to climate change, which has been responsible for the increase in heatwaves in recent decades.

"The three hottest years ever recorded in the WHO European region have occurred since 2020, and the ten hottest years since 2007," explained Kluge.

According to the United Nations organization, it is possible to cope with the heat by adopting simple behaviours, such as keeping the house cool and hydrating regularly.

On July 25, the head of the UN, António Guterres, called for an "epidemic" of extreme heat and advocated concrete measures to tackle this "invisible killer".

For the UN Secretary-General, it is necessary to take care of vulnerable people, protect exposed workers and limit the global temperature increase to 1.5°C.
