Russia ready for talks with Ukraine to end war

Russia said on Thursday that it is willing to talk to Ukraine, but warned that it must first understand the extent to which Volodymyr Zelensky's government is willing to negotiate.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists that Moscow was ready to start negotiations.

"This is a difficult issue. From a legal point of view it is a problem, but from a practical point of view, we are open to achieving our goals through negotiations. Therefore, several variants are possible," said the presidential spokesman.

Zelensky's legitimacy at the head of Ukraine's presidency has been a question raised by Russia, which argues that the Ukrainian ruler's term ended on May 20. The Russian spokesman said that in addition to the "problems of Zelensky's legitimacy", there is also "the problem of the ban on establishing any contact or negotiations with the Russian side, as this ban remains in force".

"Russia is generally open to the process of negotiations, but it is necessary to understand to what extent the Ukrainian side is prepared. For now, as you can see, we've heard very different statements. Things are not very clear," he added.

Peskov's statements come after Ukraine announced on Wednesday that it was ready to negotiate with Russia, demanding "good faith".

The Ukrainian president has recently had contacts with political representatives in favor of an immediate ceasefire, such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n, Republican US presidential candidate Donald Trump and Vatican Secretary of State Pietro Parolin.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba also went to China this week to discuss potential peace talks between Ukraine and Russia.
