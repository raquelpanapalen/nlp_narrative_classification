The injustice of climate justice

The climate justice discourse is yet another piece of nonsense in the debate led by groups on the watermelon left: green on the outside, red on the inside.

The combination of the two ideas, justice and climate, is aberrant. Opinions or policies with this level of absurdity must be denounced and rejected! Justice is a social concept. There is no justice without human beings in society. Climate, on the other hand, corresponds to a set of atmospheric conditions in a region over many years.

Most importantly, climate does not depend on humans. Climate depends mainly on the sun. Without the Sun, there would be no climate, no life on Earth and no human beings - watermelons or not.

The watermelon left replaces the family with the climate in national and global policymaking. In the name of climate justice, draconian environmental measures are taken. They drive industry out of Europe and make fuel prices unsustainable. Our tax burden on diesel is 44% and on gasoline 51%. We all know the consequences. More expensive transportation and products. Fewer job opportunities. Fewer jobs. Less justice.

And with everything becoming more expensive, we still have to pay for an ill-conceived energy transition. We are forced to bear environmental costs ignored by countries like China, which has almost 200 times more emissions than us. In Portugal, the watermelon left's climate justice makes the poorest and most vulnerable suffer. These are the Portuguese who are most affected by the increase in the price of basic foodstuffs. They are the ones who have to survive in cold, unheated homes, forgotten by the climate watchdogs.
