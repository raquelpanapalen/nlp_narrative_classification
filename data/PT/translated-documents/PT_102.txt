Ukrainian court orders arrest of suspect in murder of former nationalist MP

A Ukrainian court this Friday (26) ordered the pre-trial detention of the suspect in last week's murder of former ultranationalist MP Irina Farion, the local press reported.

Farion was an MP between 2012 and 2014 for the ultranationalist Svoboda party and was known for her passionate campaign against the use of the Russian language in Ukraine.

Ukrainian state broadcaster Suspilne reported that a court in Lviv, western Ukraine, had ordered the suspect to be held in custody for 60 days pending trial.

The defendant identified himself as Vyacheslav Zinchenko and was arrested this week in Dnipro, 800 kilometers east of Lviv.

The 18-year-old - who has not pleaded guilty - is charged with premeditated murder and could face up to 15 years in prison.

The authorities announced on Thursday the arrest of the suspect in the murder of Farion, a 60-year-old linguist who caused controversy for her fierce defense of the Ukrainian language after the Russian invasion that began in February 2022.

In 2023, Farion caused controversy for criticizing Ukrainian soldiers who continue to speak Russian while facing Moscow's troops.

Before the invasion, the use of Russian was widespread in Ukraine, especially in the eastern regions. Since then, many people have decided to stop speaking Russian and the authorities promote Ukrainian.

Investigators believe that the perpetrator of the shooting on July 19 may have acted on orders.

Farion's funeral brought thousands of people together in the streets of central Lviv, one of the historic strongholds of the Ukrainian nationalist movement.
