Bundestag votes in favor of draft resolution on the supply of long-range missiles to Kiev

The German parliament (Bundestag) voted on Thursday (22) in favor of a draft resolution tabled by ruling coalition groups on the supply of long-range weapons systems to Ukraine to destroy strategic targets in Russia's rear.

"382 voted in favor, 284 against, 2 abstained," said the speaker of parliament.

Earlier in the day, the Bundestag voted against the opposition Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and Alternative for Germany (AfD), which directly calls on the German government to start supplying Ukraine with Taurus cruise missiles.

"182 voted in favor, 480 against, 5 abstained," said the Bundestag president.

The main problem with the supply of Taurus missiles is their range of 500 kilometers, which makes them capable of reaching deep into Russian territory. Germany has not previously supplied Kiev with weapons with similar characteristics. The German expert community even discussed whether the missiles could be programmed so that they could not be used against Russian territory.

The Kremlin has consistently warned against continued Western arms deliveries to Ukraine, saying that they only prolong the conflict, adding that Western military equipment will eventually be destroyed. Moscow also warned that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries "are playing with fire" by supplying weapons to Kiev.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov emphasized that any cargo containing weapons for Ukraine will become a legitimate target for Russia. According to him, the US and NATO are directly involved in the Ukraine conflict, supplying weapons and training soldiers in the UK, Germany, Italy and other countries.
