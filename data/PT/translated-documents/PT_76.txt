Russia is giving up on Kharkiv after "failure"

Russia is now "throwing everything it has" at the eastern front, says Zelenskyy. Kremlin denies it: "operation is underway".

A few months after Moscow began the operation, Kharkiv is preparing to see the Russians leave after the "failure" of the onslaught with better troops in the north-eastern region of Ukraine, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.

According to Zelenskyy's recent interview, Russia is now "throwing everything it has" at the eastern front, where it has intensified fighting near the city of Pokrovsk.

"Their main focus is no longer the entire east, although Sloviansk [a city in northern Donetsk bordering the Kharkiv region] is not excluded," added the Ukrainian leader.

In June, Zelenskyy had already described the failure of the operation.

"I spoke to the commander-in-chief about the general situation. A very significant result is that the Russian army has failed in its operation in Kharkiv. Now we are containing them as much as possible and destroying Russian units that enter our territory and terrorize the Kharkiv region," said the Ukrainian President.

Russia, however, has already denied giving up territory, according to The Moscow Times.

"This operation is ongoing and will continue until it is successfully completed," said Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, on July 17.

The truth is that in a July 24 update, Ukrainian forces near the city described the fighting as "tense and difficult".

Ukraine's second largest city, Kharkiv was besieged by around 30,000 Russian soldiers, who entered several villages and thus reopened the north-eastern front of the war. The city lacked the necessary defenses that should have been prepared, said experts and commanders in the war that has been going on since 2022.
