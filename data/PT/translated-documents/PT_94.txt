More than 200 civilians killed in Russia's Belgorod region since invasion

"More than 1,100 peaceful residents have been injured and more than 200 people have been killed," Viacheslav Gladkov told the Russian news agency TASS about the casualties caused by Ukrainian drone and artillery attacks on the region.

The Belgorod region shares 540 kilometers of border with Ukraine and is the entity in the Russian Federation most affected by Ukrainian military actions.

According to data provided by the local authorities last April, since the beginning of the war more than 120 civilians have been killed in the region as a result of Ukrainian attacks.

In recent weeks there has been an upsurge in attacks on this Russian region, which from west to south borders the Ukrainian provinces of Sumi, Kharkiv and Lugansk, the latter annexed by Russia in September 2022.

The Russian military offensive on Ukrainian territory, launched on February 24, 2022, plunged Europe into what is considered the most serious security crisis since the Second World War (1939-1945).

Ukraine has been relying on financial and arms aid from the Western allies, who have also enacted sanctions against key sectors of the Russian economy in an attempt to reduce Moscow's ability to finance the war effort.

The last few months have been marked by large-scale Russian air strikes against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure, while Kiev's forces have been targeting targets on Russian territory close to the border and on the Crimean peninsula, illegally annexed in 2014.

Now in the third year of the war, the Ukrainian armed forces are facing a shortage of soldiers, weapons and ammunition, despite repeated promises of help from Western allies, which have since begun to materialize.
