Russia held secret meetings with the US on the war in Ukraine

Serguei Lavrov confirmed "never disclosed contacts" with the Americans. They didn't produce the desired result.

Russia held secret meetings with the US to try to end the war in Ukraine.

Serguei Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister, confirmed that a group of Russian political scientists and experts met with US specialists.

"We had hitherto undisclosed contacts with Americans, through political scientists who knew and understood the governments' policies," Lavrov announced on the sidelines of the United Nations Security Council.

The phrase was quoted on Thursday by Folha de S. Paulo, the newspaper that reported on these attempts at a peace agreement in March.

The meetings functioned as a sort of screening of what was acceptable to both countries - but Ukraine never had representatives at these meetings.

The Russian and US governments authorized these meetings, even if they weren't official.

The negotiations lasted a little over a year but, according to the Russian minister, they didn't have the desired outcome. In practice, they were of no use.

Serguei Lavrov only shared one other topic raised at these meetings: the status of ethnic Russians within Ukraine.

It should be remembered that Russian President Vladimir Putin had said before the war that Russian culture was being sidelined in Ukraine, for example with the law limiting the use of the Russian language in the Ukrainian education system.

So far, there have only been official meetings between Russians and Ukrainians at the very beginning of the war.

But, like these, those negotiations, first in Belarus and then in Turkey, did not end with a peace agreement - and were never held again.
