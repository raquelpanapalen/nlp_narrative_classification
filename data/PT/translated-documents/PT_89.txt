EU withdraws meeting of Hungarian foreign ministers over country's stance on war in Ukraine

The European Union's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, on Monday withdrew from Hungary a meeting of EU foreign ministers due to take place in Budapest, in a reaction by the bloc to the country's rapprochement with Russia over the war in Ukraine.

Borrell said that the meeting at the end of August would now take place in Brussels, after Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán visited Moscow and Beijing without EU support, and said that his government defined European policy as "pro-war".

"We have to send a signal, albeit a symbolic one," Borrell told reporters in Brussels at the last meeting of foreign ministers before the summer break.

Orbán began the trip, which also included a visit to US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, just days after Hungary took over the rotating EU presidency on July 1.

At Monday's meeting, several foreign ministers expressed strong condemnation of the Hungarian minister, Peter Szijjarto, according to the authorities.

"This was done very clearly and repeatedly so as to leave no room for doubt," said Portuguese Foreign Minister Paulo Rangel.

Several European countries consider Hungary to be too close to Moscow, sabotaging the EU's efforts to isolate Russia politically and diplomatically because of its invasion of Ukraine. Hungary says it seeks to bring peace to Ukraine as soon as possible.
