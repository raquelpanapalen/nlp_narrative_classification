Spain arrests three people for cyber attacks against countries supporting Ukraine

Spanish police arrested three people on Saturday (20) accused of taking part in cyber attacks by a pro-Russia group against public institutions and strategic sectors in the country and other NATO members.

The attacks were directed against countries that support Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion, which began in February 2024.

Two of the suspects were arrested in Huelva and Seville, in southern Spain, while the third was detained in the Balearic Islands, a statement from the Guardia Civil said.

They were arrested for "crimes of computer damage for terrorist purposes". The three people are alleged to have taken part in attacks organized by the Russian-linked hacker group "NoName057(16)", according to the statement.

"The main activity of this group is to carry out distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against the websites of public and private organizations in the government sectors, critical infrastructure and essential services," said the Civil Guard.

The security agency detailed that the group's main activity consisted of organizing DDoS attacks with "software developed by the group itself (...), named DDoSia" and which can be "used voluntarily by individuals who support the purposes of this organization".

The Civil Guard statement also indicated that the group's aim was to respond to the "hostile and openly anti-Russian actions of Western Russophobes".

In mid-June, Swiss government websites suffered a wave of DDoS attacks ahead of a peace summit in Ukraine, in an operation claimed by NoName057(16).

The attack targeted the portals of the federal government and the organizations participating in the peace summit, according to Bern.
