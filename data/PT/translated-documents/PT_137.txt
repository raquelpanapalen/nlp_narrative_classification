Trumpism's 'Nice to meet you' radicalism

The Republican convention here in Milwaukee brings together party officials and delegates from all the American states and territories. Few are from the poorer sectors of the population. They are mostly white men in suits with Trumpist caps. There was little diversity in the audience. The atmosphere was festive. I didn't witness any hostility. Many of the issues are legitimate. But the radicalism at other times of people with that "Nice to meet you" smile is frightening.

In his speech, Donald Trump once again used a slogan already famous in the current campaign. "Drill baby, drill!" they shouted. This phrase in English indicates that oil drilling should be one of the Republican's priorities if he wins the election, ignoring warnings about the risks of using this polluting energy at a time of worsening climate change.

Immigration is another point that draws attention when Trump uses terms like "invasion" to describe the migratory movement into the US from the Mexican border. The immigrants, who include many families with children, are classified as criminals by the former president. His voters cheer, shout "build the wall" and display signs that read "mass deportation".

Armaments are also an ever-strong theme among Trumpists. At the convention, there were a number of T-shirts with slogans about the right to own and carry guns. An irony, since guns are banned at the convention, except in the hands of the police and the secret service. More seriously, Trump was almost killed by a 20-year-old who had access to an AR15 rifle and still didn't change his mind.

It's surreal to see some smiling, friendly women and men transform themselves by defending radical policies. It reminded me of when I interviewed Israeli settlers and Palestinian radicals in the past. They sympathetically talk about absurdities as if they were normal.
