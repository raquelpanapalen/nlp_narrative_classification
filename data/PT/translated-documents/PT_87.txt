Former Russian president says Ukraine's NATO membership would mean "war"

Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said that Ukraine joining NATO would be a declaration of war against Moscow and that only "prudence" on behalf of the alliance could prevent the planet from being torn apart.

The leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization pledged at their summit last week to support Ukraine on an "irreversible path towards full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership", but left open when this might happen.

Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council and a leading voice among Kremlin hawks, told the media outlet Argumenty I Fakty that Ukraine's membership would go beyond a direct threat to Moscow's security.

"This, in essence, would be a declaration of war - albeit a belated one," he said in comments published on Wednesday.

"The actions that Russia's opponents have been taking against us for years, expanding the alliance, bring NATO to a point of no return."

In a standard Kremlin line since Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Medvedev said that Russia did not threaten Nato, but would respond to the alliance's attempts to promote its interests.

"The more such attempts there are, the tougher our responses will become," Medvedev said. "Whether this will tear the whole planet apart depends solely on the prudence of the (Nato) side."
