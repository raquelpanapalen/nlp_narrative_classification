Foreign ministers of China and Russia meet on the sidelines of a ministerial meeting in Laos

The foreign ministers of Russia and China met on Thursday (25) and talked about building "a new security architecture", Moscow said after the meeting, which took place on the sidelines of the meeting of ministers of the National Association of Southeast Asia (ASEAN) in Laos.

At the meeting, Russian Foreign Minister Serguei Lavrov and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi discussed "in detail" issues of cooperation within ASEAN, the Russian minister said in a statement published after the meeting in Vientiane, the capital of Laos.

Lavrov said that at a time when "some countries" are creating "a close alliance" with political-military mechanisms aimed at undermining security and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, the two foreign ministers discussed building "a new security architecture".

Wang said that China is "ready to work with Russia to keep the Asean-centered regional cooperation architecture open and inclusive" in the face of "external disturbances and obstacles," the Chinese state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

Lavrov and Wang were speaking on the sidelines of the annual ministerial meeting of Asean's ten members, which began on Thursday and will last three days, with foreign ministers from outside the regional bloc also attending.

The head of US diplomacy, Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, is scheduled to attend the ministerial meeting on Saturday.

The meeting comes a day after Wang met with his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, in China.

China is an ally of Russia and NATO members consider that Beijing has played a "decisive" role for Moscow since the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Before the meeting, Lavrov declared that ASEAN is "one of the essential elements for a new, fairer multipolar order".
