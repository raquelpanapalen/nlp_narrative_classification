Ukraine detains 30 officials suspected of allegedly embezzling almost 3 million euros in military funds

The Ukrainian Prosecutor General's Office announced on Friday the arrest of 30 people during a large-scale operation across the country on suspicion of a conspiracy to embezzle military equipment worth almost 3 million euros.

The suspects were detained on the assumption that they were "organizers and participants in criminal schemes with embezzlement of budgetary funds intended to meet the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine," it said in a statement on the social network 'Telegram'.

In a statement, the Prosecutor General's Office stressed that "a large-scale special operation was carried out to uncover the organizers and participants in criminal schemes involving the embezzlement of budget funds allocated to meet the needs of the Ukrainian Armed Forces," it wrote, pointing out that "employees of housing maintenance units in cooperation with representatives of commercial entities were found to be involved in the embezzlement of funds in almost all oblasts of Ukraine."

The detainees are 15 alleged members of criminal organizations and another 15 local civil servants, including, for example, three officials from the city of Kharkiv, or seven from the regions of Lviv, Chernigov or Yitomir.

Specifically, they are accused of "inflating the prices" of firewood, electricity or natural gas and infrastructure for military use, as well as the "illegal acquisition of assets in the form of commercial property and land".

This is the latest example of the anti-corruption initiative promoted by the country's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, following requests from the international community to facilitate its accession process to the European Union and NATO.

These issues are a source of concern for Ukraine's allies, led by the United States, which has provided tens of billions of euros in financial and military assistance since the invasion of Russia in February 2022.
