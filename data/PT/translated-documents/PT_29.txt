Sending NATO soldiers to Ukraine is a "doomsday alert", says Slovak prime minister

The Prime Minister of Slovakia, Robert Fico, said on Saturday (2) that the deployment of European Union (EU) and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) soldiers in Ukraine could precipitate a global apocalypse.

In a video posted on social media, he highlighted Ukraine's inability to resolve the conflict, despite the substantial financial and military aid provided by the West.

He stressed that while the military presence of the EU and NATO could potentially change the dynamics of the conflict, it could also trigger catastrophic consequences. "The West sees that, despite significant financial and military aid, Ukraine is incapable of resolving this armed conflict."

"The situation could change with the arrival of EU and NATO troops in Ukraine, but then there would be nothing left but to wait for the global apocalypse to arrive," said the Slovak Prime Minister.

Fico stressed the pressing need for modern air defense systems for Ukraine, but warned that the West cannot supply these systems without a commitment to maintain and operate this equipment.

He also argued that sending in Western military personnel would only aggravate the conflict, rather than resolve it.

Russia has continued its special military operation in Ukraine since February 2022. Russian President Vladimir Putin justified the action as a measure to protect the population from "genocide" by the Kiev regime and to contain NATO's eastward advance.

Moscow has repeatedly warned against the supply of arms to Kiev by the West, saying that foreign convoys carrying weapons would be legitimate targets for its forces as soon as they crossed the border.

In addition, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused the United States and NATO of already being directly involved in the conflict in Ukraine, not only by supplying weapons, but also by training personnel in several European countries.
