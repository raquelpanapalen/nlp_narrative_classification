Hungarian party wants to annex Ukrainian region if Ukraine loses war

The leader of Hungary's far-right 'Our Fatherland Movement' party, Laszlo Toroczkai, said on Saturday that he would claim the Ukrainian region of Transcarpathia, which borders Hungary in western Ukraine and is home to around 150,000 Hungarians, if the country invaded by Russia loses the war.

According to the Reuters news agency, Toroczkai's remarks were made at a party press conference, which was also attended by leaders of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party and the Forum for Democracy in the Netherlands, among others.

"With regard to the war, our message is very simple: an immediate ceasefire, peace and resolution through talks," said the politician.

"If this war ends with Ukraine losing its statehood, because that is also happening, then, as the only Hungarian party to take this position, let me signal that we will claim Transcarpathia," he said.

It should be noted that Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022, on the grounds of protecting the pro-Russian separatist minorities in the east and "denazifying" the neighboring country, which has been independent since 1991, after the break-up of the former Soviet Union, and which has been moving away from Moscow's sphere of influence and closer to Europe and the West.

The war in Ukraine has caused tens of thousands of deaths on both sides, but there has been no significant progress in the theater of operations in recent months, with the two belligerents remaining unyielding in their territorial positions and not open to compromise.

The last few weeks have been marked by large-scale Russian air strikes against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure, while Kyiv forces have been targeting targets on Russian territory close to the border and on the Crimean peninsula, illegally annexed in 2014.
