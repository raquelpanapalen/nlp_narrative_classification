Zelensky plans second peace summit in November and says Russia should take part

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Monday that he intends to have a plan ready by November to allow Kiev to hold a second international summit on his vision for peace in the country, adding that representatives from Russia should take part.

Ukraine hosted delegations from 92 countries at a first summit in Switzerland last month to present its peace project. Russia, which invaded Ukraine in February 2022, was not invited to the event and dismissed its relevance.

"I have set a goal that by November we will have a fully ready plan," Zelensky said at a press conference in Kiev. "I think that Russia's representatives should be present at the second summit."

Zelensky made the statements after returning from a visit to Washington for a summit of the Western military alliance North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) last week.

The Ukrainian authorities had previously said that Russian representatives could be invited to a new summit.

The Russian deputy foreign minister said last week that Moscow would not take part in a new summit. The Kremlin was less categorical and said that there was "no precise substance" to the idea of a second summit.

The first summit discussed three of the 10 points put forward by Ukraine as Zelensky's peace "formula", including food security, nuclear safety and the release of prisoners of war and children.

The Ukrainian authorities said that the second summit would discuss a plan drawn up in advance by dozens of countries divided into working groups.

Zelensky said that the authorities would probably meet in Qatar in late July or early August to define a position on energy security. A meeting on food security is due to take place in Turkey in August and another in Canada in September on prisoners of war and children, he said.
