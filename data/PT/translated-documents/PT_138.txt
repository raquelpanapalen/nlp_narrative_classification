NASA says Brazil could be uninhabitable in 50 years; understand

Heat is likely to make human life impossible in at least five regions of the Earth in the next 50 years, including Brazil, according to a study by the North American Space Agency (NASA).

The research found that rising temperatures combined with high levels of humidity could cause thermal effects to which the human body would be unable to adapt.

The emission of greenhouse gases has a direct impact on nature, with increasingly rapid and severe climate change across the planet. Rising temperatures often cause unseasonable heat waves and winters that are less intense or shorter than usual.

According to NASA, the process of cooling the body takes place through perspiration, i.e. sweat. The increase in temperature combined with humidity increases the sensation of heat and prevents sweat from evaporating, which keeps the body warm - and can be fatal.

The study indicates that thermometers above 37ºC - a mark exceeded in many regions of Brazil during the summer - with air humidity of 70% or more can cause early death within six hours of exposure.

The body can still sweat at a temperature of 45ºC and up to 20% humidity. However, the research projects that with the thermometer at the same mark and a humidity index above 40%, the thermal sensation can exceed 71ºC and be lethal.

Although the combination of these factors is considered rare, since hot days are characterized by drier air, the study found that the phenomenon has been observed in regions of the Persian Gulf and Pakistan since 2005.

In this scenario, NASA considered the tendency for thermometers to rise in the coming decades, with climate change driven by greenhouse gas emissions, and concluded that human life could be threatened in areas of central-western, northern, northeastern and southeastern Brazil.
