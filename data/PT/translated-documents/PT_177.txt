Extreme heatwave: what to do to avoid risks to your body

Family doctor points out measures that can be taken to minimize the effect of extreme temperatures, but draws attention to the lack of public policies for adapting to climate change.

Brazil began the last week of winter facing a wave of extreme heat. An atmospheric blockade has prevented the arrival of the cold fronts common for the season and has promised temperatures above 40ยบ C in several regions, especially in the Midwest and Southeast.

The effects of this temperature spike can go beyond mere discomfort. It is possible to develop cases of hyperthermia and heatstroke, which can even cause death - especially among the most vulnerable populations, such as children and the elderly.

Can you die from the heat? A doctor explains

In an interview with Natuza Nery, family and community doctor Mayara Floss explains what measures can be taken to minimize the effect of extreme temperatures, and also draws attention to the lack of public policies for adapting to climate change.

"Regions, for example, of slums, regions that have few trees - where there are vast monocultures... These demographic factors put these populations at risk," he says.

To mitigate the effects of the heat in everyday life, Mayara mentions measures such as: carrying a lighter change of clothes to use on public transport during peak hours; placing a bottle of cold water to cool down areas in the folds of the body, such as the armpits; if possible, prioritizing working hours in the early morning, avoiding the times when the temperature rises the most; leaving the house more ventilated at night and more closed during the day.
