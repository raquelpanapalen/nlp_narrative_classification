Climáximo protesters throw red paint at Navigator headquarters

The collective accuses the "cellulose industry" of being responsible for the fires and the seven deaths this week. The protesters were arrested and the company will file a criminal complaint.

Two members of the Climáximo collective threw red paint at Navigator's headquarters in Lisbon this Friday, accusing the paper manufacturing company of being responsible for the forest fires and the deaths that resulted from them.

The two people then sat down in front of the entrance, on Av. Fontes Pereira de Melo, and were subsequently arrested by the PSP, according to a source from this police force who confirmed this to PÚBLICO, for the crime of damage.

An official source from Navigator told PÚBLICO that it "strongly repudiates this and all acts of vandalism" and that it "will file a criminal complaint against those responsible for this act of vandalism".

In a statement issued by Climáximo, protestor Alice Gato, 22, said that "the seven deaths this week" in the fires that ravaged central and northern Portugal "are the direct result of a coordinated offensive between the state, the cellulose industry and the fossil industry to turn the interior of our country into an incineration chamber

This is the second time this week that Climáximo has targeted Navigator's facilities. On Tuesday, members of the group had pasted posters on the company's doors, accusing it of "increased responsibility for the deaths" during the fires.

"In the hottest summer on record, the current plans by governments and companies like Navigator to increase greenhouse gas emissions and continue selling off the interior of our country to the paper industry are a violent crime," argues the climate collective.
