EU transfers over 9 billion dollars in frozen Russian assets to Ukraine

The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said that the European Union will transfer 1.5 billion euros in frozen Russian assets to Ukraine this Friday, the 26th.

The decision comes after G7 and EU leaders agreed last month to use 50 billion dollars from the proceeds of frozen Russian assets in European banks to finance arms purchases and reconstruction in the embattled country.

"Today we transferred 1.5 billion euros in proceeds from frozen Russian assets to the defense and reconstruction of Ukraine. There is no better symbol or use for the Kremlin's money than to make Ukraine and the whole of Europe a safer place to live," von der Leyen wrote on her social networks.

Western governments have frozen 300 billion dollars from the Russian central bank in response to the invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal thanked the EU for "its steadfast support and this significant contribution to the defense and reconstruction of Ukraine". "Together, we are turning adversity into strength and building a safer and more resilient Europe," he said.

What Russia says

Following the EU's announcement, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the shipment of the frozen Russian goods to Ukraine "illegal" and said that Russia would take "well-thought-out actions" in response.

"Such measures by the European Commission will not go unanswered," he said.

This is not the first time that Russia has threatened retaliation against the use of its frozen assets to finance Ukraine. Last month, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the use of these assets is "theft that will not go unpunished."
