Russia restricts civilian access to villages in border region bombed by Ukraine

Access to 14 villages in the Belgorod region of southern Russia, on the border with Ukraine, will be closed to most civilians, governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Tuesday, citing the "extremely difficult" situation due to Ukrainian shelling.

Announcing the new restrictions in a video posted on his Telegram channel, Gladkov said that from next week, only adult men accompanying military or government officials will be allowed to enter the sites. The men must travel in armored vehicles and wear bulletproof vests and helmets, he added.

"I hope you will agree that it is unacceptable to allow women and children into settlements that are bombed every day," Gladkov said.

"We have already lost many civilians, we have many wounded. And, of course, our task is to maximize security measures."

The Belgorod region is under frequent fire from Ukrainian shelling and drones.

Air raid sirens sound almost daily in the regional capital of the same name, just 40 km north of the border.

Ukraine says that Russian shelling of Ukrainian cities has been devastating and, after almost two and a half years of war, Russian forces are now in control of around a fifth of Ukraine.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said in May that Russian forces are working to create a buffer zone in north-eastern Ukraine to protect Russia from attacks launched by Kiev forces from across the border.

Gladkov's announcement is a sign that the security situation in the region may have become more serious, prompting the authorities to do more to protect the civilian population.

More than 200 civilians have been killed in the Belgorod region since the start of what Moscow calls its "special military operation" in Ukraine in February 2022, Gladkov told state news agency Tass on Tuesday. More than 1,100 have been injured.
