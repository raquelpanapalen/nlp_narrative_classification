EU transfers part of profits on frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine

This Friday (26), the European Union transferred around 1.5 billion euros in support of Ukraine, from the profits generated by Russian assets frozen in the bloc.

EU countries agreed in May to use billions of euros generated by these assets to arm Ukraine and fund its post-war reconstruction.

The EU has frozen around 200 billion euros in Russian Central Bank assets held in the bloc as part of sanctions imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Around 90% of these funds are under the control of the Belgium-based financial services company Euroclear.

"The EU supports Ukraine. Today we transferred 1.5 billion euros from Russian assets mobilized for the defense and reconstruction of Ukraine," said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in a statement.

The bloc announced that 90% of the profits would go to a fund used to buy weapons for Kiev, known as the European Peace Facility. The other 10% would go to the EU fund to support the reconstruction of Ukraine.

Russia called the measure "illegal".

"This is a reason to take action in response to illegal decisions like this, which are implemented by the European Union," Dmitri Peskov, spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin, told the press.

Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shymgal thanked the EU for its support.

"Thank you, Von der Leyen and the EU, for your firm support and this important contribution to the defense and reconstruction of Ukraine," he posted on his social networks.
