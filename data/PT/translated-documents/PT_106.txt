Russian warships make routine visit to Cuba

Havana residents saw the arrival of Russian warships for the second time in a few months, in a visit that the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces called routine.

The Cuban authorities fired shots into the air to mark the welcome, while curious fishermen watched Havana's promenade and the ships advance across the bay. Russian residents were among the few who woke up early to see the arrival of the fleet.

The patrol ship Neustrahimiy, the training ship Smolniy, and the support ships - all from the Baltic Fleet - are scheduled to leave on Tuesday.

In June, a Russian nuclear submarine, a frigate and support ships exercised Moscow's muscles in the port of Havana, less than 160 kilometers from Florida.

"Russia's movements in the Atlantic pose no direct threat or concern to the United States," said a spokesman for US Northern Command, adding that the command monitored all approaches to North America.

Tensions between the United States and Russia have increased since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and Russian naval activity - although routine in the Atlantic - has increased due to US support for Ukraine, US officials say.

At the same time, relations between Russia and Cuba, Cold War allies, have improved significantly as the communist-ruled country struggles with an economic crisis that it blames mainly on US sanctions.
