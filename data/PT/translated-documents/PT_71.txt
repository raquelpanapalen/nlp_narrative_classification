Russia has threatened that F16s promised to Kiev will be shot down

Russia threatened on Thursday that the F-16 fighters promised to Ukraine by the West will be shot down, arguing that these aircraft will have little effect on the battlefield.

"There is no magic remedy or panacea and the Kiev regime's air force will not have such a panacea," argued Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov, adding that "these planes (...) will be shot down."

"But it is clear that these deliveries cannot have a significant impact on the course of events on the front line," he added.

For almost two years, Ukraine has been asking its Western allies to supply F-16s, considered the 'jewel in the crown' of the extensive list of military equipment that Kiev has requested from its supporters.

According to some media reports, the US-made fighters have already been delivered. Several NATO countries have pledged to supply a varying number of fighters and have been training Ukrainian pilots and crews for months.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has made improving air defenses one of his priorities in meetings with allies, following Russia's strong air campaign in recent months.

In an interview with the France Presse news agency in May, Zelensky detailed the need for around 130 F-16s to ensure fairness with the Russian air force. However, Ukraine's partners have pledged to send less than 100 F-16s to date, with the bulk of the planes likely to arrive over several years, following pilot training.
