UN event brings together young people in Porto Alegre to tackle climate change

Young people from all over Rio Grande do Sul will gather in Porto Alegre next weekend, August 17 and 18, for the LCOY - Local Conference of Brazilian Youth on Climate Change. The event, which will be held at the Caixa Econ√¥mica Federal Staff Association in Rio Grande do Sul (APCEF), is an initiative of YOUNGO, the official youth group of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

The event seeks to involve young people in discussion and action on climate change. During the conference, a document will be drawn up to be sent directly to the Youth Conference (COY 19) and the Conference of the Parties (COP 29), international discussion events on climate change that will take place in Azerbaijan this year.

"Having an international event here in the state is incredible, because it's an opportunity for us to show the world the challenges we face here, such as the progress of extreme weather events, the rampant degradation of the Pampa and the dismantling of environmental laws. At the same time, we're creating solutions collaboratively, together with other young people in the state," says Thais Yutori, a climate activist who is organizing the event and is part of Eco Pelo Clima.

For her, the presence of young people from Rio Grande do Sul at LCOY reinforces the importance of community involvement and collaboration in initiatives that seek immediate solutions to climate challenges. "Rio Grande do Sul has been highly impacted by the climate crisis. We recently went through the biggest flood ever seen in the history of our state, we need to involve young people in building solutions that will impact the future that is already ours," says Thais.
