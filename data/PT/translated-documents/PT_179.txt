Ethiopia and FAO sign program to fight climate change

The Regional Livestock and Pasture Program for Climate Adaptation in the East/North Africa region will be implemented in four cross-border group areas, including Mandera and Karamoja (Ethiopia), Mara-Serengeti (Tanzania) and Bahr Al Arab (Sudan and South Sudan).

Kenya, Somalia and Uganda are other countries targeted in the 47 million euro EU-funded project, of which 6.25 million euros are for Addis Ababa, the local state portfolio revealed.

Fikru Regasa, Ethiopia's state minister for the sector, highlighted the fight against climate change and local efforts to deal with its effects, especially in the pastoral area.

For his part, the FAO representative in the country, Farayi Zimudzi, said that the program is in line with the UN agency's strategic framework for "Better Production, Better Nutrition, Better Environment, Better Life".

Zimudzi added that Ethiopia's Ministry of Agriculture is the main implementing partner of the initiative and plays a coordinating role at federal, regional and cluster level (a group of interrelated and geographically concentrated companies and institutions competing in the same business).

The regional program is also expected to improve resilience to man-made disasters in pastoral and agricultural communities in the target areas.

It has been pointed out that livestock in pastoral areas perform various functions, including economic, social and cultural. Over the centuries, livestock keepers have also provided ecosystem services that are difficult to convert into commercial and intangible values, encompassing many interrelated environmental benefits.
