Poland comments on opposition to use of frozen Russian assets

Poland today commented on the opposition within the European Union (EU) to the use of dividends from frozen assets of the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) in Western financial institutions for the purchase of arms from Ukraine, the capital's press indicated.

Two EU countries have yet to reach a consensus on the use of profits from the retention of some 300 billion dollars in BCR banks, said the head of Polish diplomacy, Rodoslav Sikorsky, quoted by radio station RMF24.

The Polish Chancellor revealed that he had raised the issue of the frozen funds with his French counterpart, Stéphane Séjourné, during a recent meeting of EU foreign ministers.

Canada, the United States, Japan and the EU are holding BCR assets, including almost six billion dollars on US soil, while 210 billion are deposited in the Euroclear bank in Belgium.

Several European nations at the time proposed using dividends from the frozen Russian money to finance Ukraine's rearmament, something rejected by Moscow, which is threatening to apply painful response measures.

Russia also warns that such a move would set a disastrous precedent for the international financial system, since many countries, especially developing ones, keep their assets in Western banks because of their high reliability, which would now be called into question.

Despite this, the main leaders of the group of the seven most industrialized countries (France, the United States, Japan, Canada, Italy, the United Kingdom and Germany) agreed to allocate 50 billion dollars to the purchase of arms from Ukraine, from funds withheld.
