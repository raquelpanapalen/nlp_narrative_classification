Southeastern Europe has an unusually hot summer: Greece records hottest July ever

July 2024 went down in history as the hottest month ever recorded in Greece, according to preliminary data analyzed by the scientific team at meteo.gr and the Athens National Observatory. This heat record not only surpassed the average July temperatures for the period 1991-2020 by 2.9 °C, but also surpassed the previous record of July 2012 by 0.3 °C.

July 2024: a month of historic records in Greece and around the world

Analysis of climate data revealed that July 2024 was marked by long periods of exceptionally high temperatures, significantly exceeding seasonal norms across the country. This pattern of extreme heat is in line with a worrying trend observed in recent decades: since 1960, the average July temperature in Greece has increased by 2.5 °C.

Furthermore, in the last four years, three of the four hottest July months in the last 80 years have been recorded in Greece, highlighting a growing trend of extreme temperatures attributed to climate change. In addition, the persistent heat of July 2024 was compounded by one of the longest heatwave periods since 1980. This heatwave occurred between July 8 and 23.

But anyone who thinks that this trend is limited to Greece should be mistaken. In fact, on a global level, July 21, 2024 was considered to be the hottest day ever, with an average global temperature of 17.1 °C, as reported by the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service. This record was surpassed again the following day, July 22, with the average global temperature reaching 17.2 °C.

Adaptation and mitigation measures: Greece's response to extreme heat

The inherent concerns cannot be overlooked. The Greek authorities have been taking measures to adapt and mitigate against the impacts of extreme temperatures. During peak heat, several cities have opened air-conditioned centers to help the vulnerable population.

In addition, there has been an increase in preparedness and response to forest fires, which are a greater threat during periods of extreme heat. Take, for example, the concern shown by civil protection officials, who close Greece's most visited monument, the Acropolis in Athens, between 12pm and 5pm when the heat is at its worst.

The data for July 2024 reinforces the urgency of concrete measures to adapt to climate change. The record-breaking temperatures, not only in Greece but globally, are a clear sign of the intensification of extreme weather phenomena, which have expanded into the month of August.

Take, for example, the days with very high temperatures that have continued throughout Europe and Greece in particular at the beginning of this month, and which will continue for at least the next few weeks.
