Chega MP in Cascais doesn't spare the "outspoken neo-Nazi with a long criminal record"

They are together in Homophobia and Xenophobia, but at completely opposite poles when it comes to the Invasion of Ukraine, which is nothing new for Chega supporters, were it not for André Ventura's party, the party of contradictions. Maria Vieira, Chega's Municipal Deputy in Cascais, doesn't spare Chega supporter and "outspoken neo-Nazi", Mário Machado, "who has a long criminal record involving bodily harm, possession of illegal weapons, kidnapping and extortion, among other things", for having decided to travel to Ukraine to join the neo-Nazi militias that are part of the Ukrainian National Guard.

Mário Machado, an outspoken neo-Nazi who has a long criminal record involving bodily harm, possession of illegal weapons, kidnapping and extortion, among other less-than-reputable things, decided to travel to Ukraine to join the neo-Nazi militias that are part of the Ukrainian National Guard and which support and are in turn supported and sustained by President Zelensky in the armed conflict against Russia. And I cannot stress enough all the things that the lying and corrupt TV channels refuse to report about this neo-Nazi battalion, which has been accused of war crimes against civilian populations in eastern Ukraine since 2014, particularly in cases of torture, rape, looting and all those "cuddly" things that Nazis love to do!

And so that the aforementioned Mário Machado can leave Portugal in the company of twenty other cronies, a judge (that's right, a judge at the Central Criminal Investigation Court) has exempted him from reporting to the police station every two weeks, following yet another case in which he is a defendant, so that he can travel freely to Ukraine, where he will allegedly go for "humanitarian reasons"!

I am a conservative, right-wing woman, I am (with great honor and pride) a municipal deputy in the municipality of Cascais for a well-known right-wing party, I am an outspoken anti-socialist and anti-communist, I have the greatest contempt for left-wing progressivism, as well as Cultural Marxism and Globalism, and I am astonished when I see a Portuguese judge granting such a privilege to a well-known neo-Nazi who is going to travel to a foreign country to join a group of people who believe in and defend a hideous ideology, responsible for the deaths of so many millions of people and which in this "art" of killing has only been surpassed by bloody communism!

This determination imposed by NATO, the EU, the UN and the damned globalists to shape the world against Russia and its president is so skewed and sickening (and I don't support either one or the other, just as I don't support Ukraine or the Ukrainian president) that we see this kind of unspeakable thing without the majority of the population being indignant about it, because after all, Mário Machado, who is a neo-Nazi, is also very human and very cuddly just because he's going to help his neo-Nazi friends in Ukraine!

For heaven's sake! What else are we going to see, sir?
