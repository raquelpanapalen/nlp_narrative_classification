Syrsky blames mistakes by Ukrainian commanders at the front for compromising the "sustainability of the defense"

The Ukrainian military's top commander acknowledged difficulties in the Avdeevka and Zaporozhie directions in his statement.

The commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on Thursday (29) accused certain commanders at the front of making miscalculations, which could only affect the "sustainability of defense".

"The situation in the area of operation of the defense forces of Ukraine remains difficult [...] The situation is particularly tense in the directions of Avdeevka and Zaporozhie," Aleksandr Syrsky pointed out.

"During the operations of certain commanders, some miscalculations were found in the management of the situation at the front, which affected the stability of the defense in certain directions," he said.

On the night of February 17, Syrsky gave the order to leave Avdeevka. During a speech at the Munich Security Conference, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky blamed the withdrawal of Ukrainian forces on a lack of sufficient assistance from the West and an "artificial shortage" of ammunition.

Earlier, the Pentagon stated that the Ukrainian military, without renewed US aid, would have to decide which cities they would be able to hold. The bill, which provides, among other things, more than 60 billion dollars (298.96 billion reais) for Kiev, has been approved by the US Senate, but is stalled in the House of Representatives, the lower house of the country's Congress.

Russia believes that arms deliveries to Ukraine and the training of its military prevent an agreement and directly involve the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries in the conflict, which are "playing with fire". Sergei Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister, said that any supplies containing arms to Ukraine would be a legitimate target for Russia.
