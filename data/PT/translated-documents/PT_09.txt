Russia's precision gliding ammunition will cause 'tremendous headache' in Ukraine, media say

The West's proxy war against Russia in Ukraine will be seen as on a downward trajectory to decimate NATO's previously fearsome reputation for expensive, high-tech weaponry. At the same time, Russian forces have unleashed a series of surprises in the conflict zone with up-to-date, cutting-edge military technology.

However, another Russian weapon has reportedly piqued the interest of the Western media, amid concerns that it could add to Kiev's headaches.

The new UMPB D-30SN interspecific glide munition seems to be attracting a lot of interest because this precision-guided winged bomb is an out-of-range weapon that is rumored to be suitable for launching from aircraft and ground-based multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS), such as Russia's Tornado-S.

An off-range weapon can be launched from a great distance, allowing the user to avoid the target's defensive fire.

"If it can also be launched from the ground, it would provide an extended and accurate range for Russian rocket artillery systems, without the need to risk tactical aircraft. This could be especially useful for hitting time-sensitive targets at long distances, such as artillery positions and air defense systems," wrote the US portal The War Zone (TWZ).

According to the publication, although details about the munition were still limited, the gliding weapon similar to a small diameter bomb drew parallels with the US GBU-39 small diameter bomb, also capable of being dropped from the air and from the ground. Ukraine, the media outlet added, received the GLSDB ground-launched version as part of the Western military aid packages received by Kiev.
