    "\n",
    "President Joe Biden's administration announced Wednesday revised pollution standards for cars and trucks meant to accelerate the US auto industry's shift to electric to mitigate climate change.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules set ambitious emission reductions for 2032 but are moderated somewhat compared with preliminary standards unveiled last April. Following carmaker criticism, the final rules give manufacturers greater flexibility and ease the benchmarks in the first three years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those shifts were criticized as a sop to corporations from at least one environmental group, even as the final rule won praise from other leading NGOs focused on climate change.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final rules -- which were described by administration official as \"the strongest ever\" and would likely be undone if Republican Donald Trump defeats Biden in November -- still require a nearly 50 percent drop in fleet-wide emissions in 2032 compared with 2026 through increased sales of electric vehicles (EVs) and low-emission autos.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules, which dovetail with other key Biden programs to build more EV charging stations and manufacturing facilities and incentivize EV sales, establish the environment as a significant point of difference in the 2024 presidential election.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trump has mocked climate change as a problem and cast the transition to EVs as a job-killer that will benefit China at the expense of American workers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Biden argues that US auto builders need to take the lead in the expanding EV market.\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"I brought together American automakers. I brought together American autoworkers,\" said Biden in a statement. \"Together, we've made historic progress.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Alluding to his target set three years ago that 50 percent of new vehicles in 2030 would be EVs, Biden predicted we'll meet my goal for 2030 and race forward in the years ahead.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- Industry given more time -\n",
    "\n",
    "EVs accounted for 7.6 percent in 2023 sales, up from 5.9 percent in 2022, according to Cox Automotive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original proposal had envisioned the EV share surging to as much as 67 percent of new vehicle sales by 2032.\n",
    "\n",
    "Carmakers, which are midway through sweeping, multi-billion-dollar investments to build more EV capacity, criticized the initial standards as overly-stringent. They cited the limited state of charging capacity in the United States that has dampened consumer demand, as well as difficulties in supply of metals and other raw materials for EV batteries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following input from the auto industry, organized labor and auto dealerships, Biden administration officials decided to allow manufacturers a \"variety of pathways\" to reaching the standard, a senior Biden administration official said Tuesday.\n",
    "\n",
    "This path could include a mix of EVs, conventional but more fuel-efficient engines, and plug-in hybrid vehicles, which have seen a rise in demand of late.\n",
    "\n",
    "Biden administration officials opted to soften year-to-year emissions improvements in the 2027-2030 period, while maintaining the same target in 2032.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moderating the targets in these first three years \"was the right call,\" said John Bozzella, president of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a Washington lobby representing carmakers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"These adjusted EV targets -‚Äì still a stretch goal ‚Äì- should give the market and supply chains a chance to catch up,\" said Bozzella, adding that the extra time will allow more EV charging stations to come on-line.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Too many 'loopholes'? -\n",
    "\n",
    "The final standards set a fleet-wide target of 85 grams of carbon dioxide in 2032, down from 170 in 2027, according to an administration fact sheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wednesday's initiative won praise from leading environmental groups including the Sierra Club and NRDC, which said the new rules \"take us in the right direction,\" according to a statement from NRDC chief Manish Bapna.\n",
    "\n",
    "But Dan Becker, director of the climate transport campaign at the Center for Biological Diversity, slammed the adjusted rules as \"significantly weaker.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"The EPA caved to pressure from Big Auto, Big Oil and car dealers and riddled the plan with loopholes big enough to drive a Ford F150 through,\" Becker said.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Monday showed up in Kiev during an unannounced visit, and at an awkward moment for US-Ukraine relations given President Zelensky has been publicly complaining over a decrease in artillery shell supplies, given they are now going to Israel for its war in Gaza.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I was honored to meet with President @ZelenskyyUa in Kyiv today to reaffirm the United States‚Äô steadfast support for Ukraine,\" Austin wrote on X. \"We, along with our allies and partners, will continue to support Ukraine‚Äôs urgent battlefield needs and long-term defense requirements,\" Austin added.\n",
    "\n",
    "This convenient shift of Washington and the Pentagon to talking mainly about \"long-term defense\" began occurring as it became clear Ukraine's counteroffensive was failing.\n",
    "\n",
    "But Congress has been dragging its feet on passing Biden's latest supplemental funding requests - again given there's been some wrangling over what gets sent to Israel vs. what's set aside for Ukraine.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is Austin's second trip to Kiev since the Russian invasion. \"I‚Äôm here today to deliver an important message ‚Äì the United States will continue to stand with Ukraine in their fight for freedom against Russia‚Äôs aggression, both now and into the future,\" he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just last week, CIA Director William Burns also made a secretive, unannounced visit to Ukraine to hold urgent meetings with Zelensky and top military and intelligence officials. Commentary in Asia Times has concluded that this flurry of activity is in response to how badly things are going on the battlefield. Washington has invested many tens of billions of dollars into what's clearly a 'proxy war' against Russia. Asia Times wrote:\n",
    "\n",
    "Wednesday, November 15th is Z-Day for the War in Ukraine. CIA Chief William Burns will arrive in Kiev for urgent, secret meetings with Zelensky. It is worth asking: How come Burns is on an urgent mission to Ukraine?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer to the question is that Ukraine is imploding. The crumbling of the Zelensky regime is unsurprising: Ukraine has been sustaining far too many casualties to survive for much longer. Ukraine either must find a way to make a deal with Russia or face an internal rebellion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, there have been recent media rumors and rumblings that Washington has begun to quietly push Kiev to the negotiating table. Was this in any way the focus of these new visits by Burns and Austin?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The Russian strategy is to bleed-down Ukraine‚Äôs armed forces and create a political crisis in Kiev,\" the Asia Times report continued. \"The Russian effort is ahead of schedule, which has surprised Moscow as much as Washington.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Zelensky has lately sacked and replaced many within his own war cabinet. All of this is a sign of deepening friction, also as Zelensky has admitted that the Gaza crisis has taken the international attention off of Ukraine's war efforts. This has led to waning monetary and weapons support as well."

    "\n",
    " by Jeff Crouere, The Liberty Daily:\n",
    "\n",
    "The world is in total chaos after 39 months of the Biden presidency. The southern border of our country is porous and millions of individuals from around the world have descended on our country.\n",
    "\n",
    "These ‚Äúundocumented migrants‚Äù include terrorists, drug dealers, and intelligence agents of countries such as our enemy, China. It should alarm every American that 22,233 Chinese nationals have illegally entered the United States since the beginning of the fiscal year in October. If this rate continues, this year‚Äôs total will easily top the 24,125 Chinese nationals who illegally entered the country last year.\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\n",
    "\n",
    "There has been an astounding 6,300% increase in the number of Chinese nationals illegally entering the country in the last few years. Since China is a communist nation, these individuals are not freely traveling to the United States for a ‚Äúbetter life.‚Äù U.S. Senator Roger Marshall (R-KS) believes the influx is due to ‚Äúthe direction of the CCP (Chinese Communist Party)‚Äù and it involves ‚Äúespionage‚Äù as well as ‚Äústealing military and economic secrets.‚Äù\n",
    "\n",
    "Last year, China sent a spy balloon over our country, and it was not shot down until it completed its trek across many states. In addition, Chinese investors are buying American farmland for nefarious reasons, and it was confirmed that China operated ‚Äúpolice stations‚Äù in the United States to monitor their citizens in our country.\n",
    "\n",
    "China is constantly threatening Taiwan and its other neighbors while building up its military forces. Their proxy state, North Korea, has started regularly testing long-range ballistic missiles that concern their neighboring countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ukraine is in the third year of a bitter war with Russia. Last year, a United States report estimated that the total number of injuries and deaths in the war neared 500,000. There is no end in sight to the war as no peace talks are planned and the United States Congress is on the verge of allocating more military aid to Ukraine.\n",
    "\n",
    "On October 7, Israel was invaded by Hamas resulting in the death of 1,200 innocent people. It was the deadliest attack on Israel since its founding in 1948. Hamas abducted over 240 hostages and 129 have not been returned home. These hostages either remain in captivity or are already deceased.\n",
    "\n",
    "As Israel has responded to the Hamas invasion by sending military forces into Gaza, many Democrats have been critical. Sadly, innocent civilians have been killed in the conflict, but how can a nation survive with a terrorist organization operating on its border?\n",
    "\n",
    "To further strengthen their security, on April 1, Israel bombed the Iranian embassy in Damascus, Syria. Among the seven officials killed in the airstrike were Iranian Brig. Gen. Mohammad Reza Zahedi, who helped plan the October 7 massacre in Israel.\n",
    "\n",
    "To retaliate for this strike, Iran launched over 300 drones and missiles into Israel on Saturday. Fortunately, almost all the strikes were intercepted by Israeli forces, with help from the United States, Jordan, and other countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the world waits to see if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will respond to this attack, the Iranians are continuing to issue threats. In an interview on their state TV network, Iranian Major General Mohammad Bagheri said, ‚ÄúOur response will be much larger than tonight‚Äôs military action if Israel retaliates against Iran.‚Äù\n",
    "\n",
    "It is being widely reported by Axios, CNN, and other media outlets that President Joe Biden is urging Netanyahu not to respond and, if he does, the United States will not be involved. This response is disturbing to U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), who believes the world is witnessing the most dangerous period for the Middle East since 1973. He said, ‚ÄúWhat I don‚Äôt understand is why Joe Biden and the administration would leak to the media the contents of a conversation in which he tells Netanyahu he doesn‚Äôt think that Netanyahu should respond at all. It is the continuing part of the public game they are playing which frankly encourages Iran and Hezbollah.‚Äù\n",
    "\n",
    "Biden has also encouraged Iran by relaxing our economic sanctions, which allowed additional oil revenue to flow into their coffers. This led to their renewed financial support for terrorist organizations like Hamas. Without Iran‚Äôs generous backing, Hamas would not have been able to launch their deadly October 7 attack against Israel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not content to allow Iran to prosper from oil sales, Biden also released $16 billion in funds for Iran, partially for the return of six American hostages. Terror regimes should never be rewarded for taking hostages, but this is exactly what happened by the Biden administration‚Äôs unwise decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the world deals with multiple international wars and unprecedented chaos in the Middle East, it is useful to remember what was happening when Donald Trump was our President.\n",

    "- The model assigned the label **\"CC: Criticism of climate movement: Ad hominem attacks on key activists\"** to the texts that include harsh criticism of specific figures or groups . This could be seen as an indirect attack on individuals or groups associated with the climate movement, even though the criticism is more focused on policies and actions.\n",

    "-  The model separates direct and indirect criticism. If the text criticizes the results of a movement without attacking people, it gets labels like **\"CC: Criticism of climate policies\"**. But if the criticism targets specific people or groups, like activists or politicians, it gets labels like **\"CC: Criticism of climate movement: Ad hominem attacks\"**.\n",
    "- The model can spot bias in the text, especially when it favors one side. For example, it might assign labels like **\"URW: Praise of Russia\"** if the text presents Russia in a positive light.\n",
    "- **Geopolitical Relevance**: When a text talks about international relations or foreign policy, the model assigns labels like **\"URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy\"**. It uses specific geopolitical labels when discussing how countries interact, like **\"URW: Praise of Russia\"**.\n",
    "- **Complex Texts**: If a text covers several topics, like politics and climate change, the model may assign multiple (sometimes even too much) labels to capture all the ideas, even if it overlaps or uses general labels like **\"Other\"**."
