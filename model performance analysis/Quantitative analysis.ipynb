However, the F1 score of 0.27 reveals poor balance between precision and recall, suggesting the model is again struggles to effectively capture relevant instances while avoiding false positives."

    "The micro average F1-score of 0.40 shows moderate overall performance, with higher precision (0.59) than recall (0.30), indicating the model identifies some relevant instances but misses many. The macro average F1-score of 0.05 highlights the model's inability to handle underrepresented classes effectively. The weighted average F1-score of 0.27 shows slightly better performance on dominant classes, though still limited. The samples average F1-score of 0.59, with higher precision (0.64) and recall (0.58), suggests the model performs relatively better in multi-label instances but has significant space for improvement overall."

    "The quantitative analysis has revealed that BERT is the best-performing model for both CC and UA tasks. Regarding CC, BERT achieved the highest micro F1-score (0.46), was quite strong in weighted F1-score (0.38), and attained a good overall balance with a score of 0.44 in terms of accuracy, which means it can manage the dominant classes. BERT also attained the same micro F1-score of 0.40 for UA, but with better balanced precision and recall compared to other models. It also has the highest accuracy at 0.51, proving good capabilities in nuanced and imbalanced narrative structures."
